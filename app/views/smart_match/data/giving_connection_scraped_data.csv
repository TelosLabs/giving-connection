RAINN also carries out programs to prevent sexual violence, help victims, and ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice. Vision: Sexual violence affects nearly every family in the nation. Every 98 seconds an American is sexually assaulted, and every 8 minutes that victim is a child. Survivors of sexual violence often experience negative psychological and physical effects, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse. Survivors who get help from trained support specialists are more likely to receive medical services and report the assault.

The national conversation around sexual violence means that survivors are contacting RAINN in record numbers. We have increased hotline capacity, yet demand is growing faster than our ability to help. Long wait times cause thousands of survivors each month to leave before connecting with our trained support specialists. Services: Victim Services: The victim services experts at RAINN take a victim-centered, trauma-informed approach to developing programs and services that support survivors of sexual violence and their loved ones. As the country’s leading provider of sexual assault services, we have developed programs to help survivors in all stages of recovery.

The season culminates in a recording session in partnership with fellow youth organization, Notes for Notes, where the girls put to practice all they learned over the semester. The overarching goal of our satellite school program is to create opportunity for youth who experience extra barriers (including geographic, transportation, and language) that prevent them from participating in our flagship program. All-City Mentorship Program We offer our flagship mentorship program at no cost to deserving middle and high school girls. Priority enrollment is granted to youth attending Title I public schools. Participants are paired with professional female songwriting mentors over the course of a 6-month season. They meet bi-weekly at approved locations. We train mentors to help their mentees uncover their authentic voice, develop instrumental skills, and advocate for their unique artistic vision. Once a month, the girls attend a youth-driven “Writers’ Guild” where they share their work with each other and engage in an artistic community. Each season culminates in a recording session at a professional studio. Participants bring their songs to life as they collaborate with an adult all-female professional studio band. Each July, the participants and the all-female adult band perform a live concert (album release show) open to the public.","Arts & Culture, Education, Youth Development",(615) 784-8725,info@girlswritenashville.org,http://www.girlswritenashville.org/,"3511 Gallatin Pike suite 103, Nashville, TN 37216, USA",Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon12:00 PM -  4:00 PM  (EDT); TueClosed; Wed12:00 PM -  4:00 PM  (EDT); ThuClosed; Fri12:00 PM -  4:00 PM  (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

Centerstone,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/8,"Mission: Centerstone helps children, adolescents, adults, seniors, and their families who suffer from a myriad of behavioral health challenges. We are one of the nation’s largest behavioral healthcare organizations, and we provide a full range of mental health services, substance use treatment, intellectual and developmental disability services, housing, educational services and community supports for people of all ages. Vision: Before we grow, before we look at expansion into new communities or developing new service lines, we always ask ourselves, “how can we take care of our current clients, our staff, and our communities?” That is and always has been our primary focus. We grow to better serve those who need us! Over the past year, we have grown in some particularly important areas, most notably in the area of telehealth or care delivered via electronic communication channels, such as telephone or video. Prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer than five percent of Centerstone’s total services were delivered via telehealth. Thanks to a huge lift from our staff, especially those working in information technology, we are now delivering tens of thousands of services each week via telehealth — making up nearly 60% of our total services. We expect for telehealth to become a much larger part of our everyday offerings as we progress into 2021 and beyond. As rates of substance use disorders continue to climb, we have grown our offering of full-service residential addiction treatment over the past year. Centerstone’s Fellowship House Campus in Illinois joined our organization this year and is already busy providing a safe environment and a full spectrum of services to people who suffer with substance use disorders and co-occurring problems. In Indiana, we expanded Centerstone’s Recovery Transitional Housing (CRT) program with two new locations, one in Bedford and one in Columbus. Another key area of growth has been expanding the availability of services to our nation’s heroes — our veterans, active duty military personnel, and military family members. We know this is a population that needs our help as it is estimated that more than 20 veterans die by suicide each day. Centerstone is fortunate to have recently expanded its partnership with Cohen Veterans Network to open a new clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, that will serve post-9/11 veterans and their families. We also were able to expand the reach of our military services into new geographic areas—notably the St. Louis, Missouri, area which is home to tens of thousands of veterans and active duty personnel. Services: Tennessee Crisis: (800) 681-7444 We offer a multitude of programs that are designed to address the wide-range of emotional, behavioral, psychological and addiction issues that affect the individuals in our care. Our mission is delivering care that changes people’s lives and we achieve that mission through a robust offering of services and programs, including: Mental Health Counseling, Addiction Recovery, Children & Family Services, Residential Care, Crisis Services, Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Services, Therapeutic Foster Care & More!

Love Learning Music,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/152,"Mission: Love Learning Music is a 501(c)3 non-profit education organization founded in response to the overwhelming developmental needs of children. Through volunteer youth mentorship, our founder, John Bosworth, realized the powerful life change that came through adaptive music education. Witnessing the positive impact, it became clear that helping children improves the entire community. Love Learning Music began by volunteering to meet the needs of children and inviting the community to join in supporting the vision to create passionate pioneers of change! The Love Learning Music mission is to use music and fine arts to educate, equip, and empower the whole person, regardless of age, ability, or socioeconomic status. Vision: The Love Learning Music vision is to help people, families, and communities live happy and rewarding lives. Our purpose is to provide therapy, education, and resources, specializing in underserved children. One of our goals is to expand our Metro Nashville Public Schools (MNPS) Extended Learning Programming. Our vision is to include group programs such as music therapy, music education, and musical theater. Musical theater would be a brand new program for Love Learning Music and would include classes on improvisation, choreography, singing, and more. Another goal for Love Learning Music is to grow our current partnerships with local organizations such as the TN Dept. of Substance Abuse & Mental Health, other 501c(3) non-profits, including Hope Kids, Move Inclusive Dance, Special Kids, Cave House Workshop, and Youth Villages, Rutherford County Schools, homeschool groups, nursing homes, and local libraries. Growing our current partnerships will increase our group and one-on-one music therapy sessions, music education classes, and private lessons. Love Learning Music also has a goal to begin in-school music education and music therapy services for youth at MNPS.

We meet in person or virtually and offer one-on-one and group music therapy sessions. Group music therapy involves two or more clients with overarching goals that benefit each group member. In contrast, one-on-one music therapy focuses on one client and their specific needs as an individual. Our music therapy sessions begin with a standard assessment that evaluates the client(s) and collects baseline data for documenting progress. Music therapy is especially beneficial to those who have suffered trauma, those with special needs, and those with mental, emotional, and behavioral struggles. Some specific benefits to development include measurable improvement in functional communication and social skills, fine and gross motor skills, managing stress and anxiety, and the ability to recall from memory. The Love Learning Music music education program provides lessons in all areas of music: singing, general music, theory, all instruments, audio production, and any other areas our students desire! Positive Growth with Music is a specialty program that uses music to aid in developing essential skills like listening and communication. Our adaptive music lessons include 1-on-1 or group music lessons designed to help those with special needs, those that have suffered trauma, or anyone that needs an adaptive approach to learning. Our general group music classes are music education classes adapted to meet each group's needs, including general music, strings, rock band, pop music, and choir. Our individual music lessons are for specific instruments, musical subjects, or audio production. We offer most instruments, audio production, video production, and musical theater lessons. This program is beneficial for providing positive mentorship. Love Learning Music's resource provision and development program decreases barriers to accessing essential, developmental, and musical resources. We provide educational technology, food, and school supplies to those in need. We also offer musical instruments for our students to keep at home so they can continue to learn and develop. Love Learning Music has a dedicated team that creates technology-aided resources, so education and encouragement are ever-present. Our current mission is to keep creating instructional videos, and our future goal is to build software-aided educational resources.","Advocacy, Arts & Culture, Children & Family Services, Disability Services, Education, Mental Health, Youth Development",(615) 624-4202,info@lovelearningmusic.org,https://www.lovelearningmusic.org/,"Nashville, TN, USA",Nashville,TN,Always Open,,success

Pawster Nashville,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/77,"Mission: When pet owners are in crisis (eviction, domestic violence, hospitalization, addiction, etc.), Pawster Nashville places their cat or dog in a loving foster home until the owner is back on their feet and ready to be reunited. This keeps pets out of shelters, and it keeps families together. Pawster Nashville's mission is to end pet homelessness before it begins, by providing short-term respite care for pets as an alternative to surrender, with the goal of reunification with their owners. Vision: Pawster envisions a world where no one has to lose a beloved furry family member because of a temporary crisis. To reach this vision, Pawster has identified several key strategic goals in the next 5 years. The goals for 2023 include: 1. Foster 55% of foster requests or 125 pets total in 2023. 2. Define three questions and insights by July 2023, provided by data in order to better define and accomplish our mission. 3. Investigate and define personnel practices/models and HR information by July 2023 and board bylaws by end of 2023, in order to effectively hire staff and recruit new board members. 4.

Services: When a pet's family is in temporary crisis and wishes to keep their dog or cat, Pawster houses their pet in a loving foster home for a maximum of 3 months. By keeping pets out of the shelter, Pawster allows shelters and rescues to save more pets who are already homeless. Moreover, crisis foster care keeps families together on the other side of crisis. While in foster care, Pawster provides all supplies and veterinary care, including wellness checks, vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter surgery and any emergency/urgent care that arises during the foster stay. When you donate to Pawster, your donation goes directly to these costs associated with providing Crisis Foster Care for dogs and cats until they can go home to their family.","Animals, Disaster Relief & Preparedness, Drug & Alcohol Treatment, Inmate & Formerly Incarcerated, Housing & Homelessness",(615) 434-4912,info@pawsternashville.org,https://www.pawsternashville.org,"Nashville, TN, USA",Nashville,TN,By Appointment Only,,success

Hope for Justice,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/123,"Mission: Hope for Justice is a charity working to bring an end to modern slavery and human trafficking and to protect the human rights of victims and survivors. Our multi-disciplinary model is based on four pillars: preventing exploitation; rescuing victims; restoring lives; and reforming society. Our global work, across four continents, is categorized as Prevent, Rescue, and Restore. Vision: We aim to solve the global issue of Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery in its various forms especially labour exploitation, sexual exploitation and domestic servitude. Services: Investigative Center: Headquartered in Nashville, TN, we operate three Regional Investigative Centers across the U.S., established in 2016. The Center's vision is to live in a world free from slavery. One of the primary ways this is achieved is by rescuing and recovering as many victims as possible and enabling others to do so. Hope for Justice is the only not-for-profit organization in the U.S. equipped to investigate independently or with law enforcement to identify and rescue victims of human trafficking. Since its launch, over 700 cases have been referred to the Investigative Center, with over half of those developing into active investigations resulting in over 150 trafficking victims recovered. A majority of all cases had been accepted for federal prosecution. Since 2017 we have trained over 30,000 frontline professionals who are most likely to come into contact with victims of human trafficking, often without realizing it. In the past year, we have developed relationships with 50 law enforcement. Phnom Penh Lighthouse, Cambodia: Our Lighthouse is a transitional shelter for girls that have been sex trafficked. The shelter provides basic needs (safe shelter, food, clothes, etc.), medical and psychological services, and a range of other services according to need – e.g., legal support, catch-up educational classes, life skills, vocational training, etc. As soon as our team of experts considers a girl has stabilized her situation, we support her reintegration with her biological family or—if deemed in the child's best interests—help her towards independent living. Whatever their path, we follow up with the children for up to two years to ensure they are not re-trafficked. Regional Centers: Hope for Justice has three regional centers in the continental United States, in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Iowa. In North Carolina, the regional center has a Health and Human Services contract to provide community-based aftercare for survivors of trafficking. All three regional centers also carry out investigative work to identify victims of trafficking and to support them to leave exploitation, working closely with relevant law enforcement agencies. Our highly trained investigators gather the evidence needed for law enforcement to pursue the perpetrators of human trafficking. All the regional centers carry out outreach activities and tailored technical training for front-line agencies domestically and overseas. Training: Hope for Justice has a range of high-quality training packages tailored to different levels of complexity and specific audiences. These packages can be delivered through our Learning Academy, an online learning platform, or blended approaches with virtual or face-to-face sessions with subject-matter experts. We have worked with the US State Dept to make our training available to US government staff worldwide.","Advocacy, Human & Social Services",615-356-0946,info@hopeforjustice.org,https://hopeforjustice.org/,"P.O.

"The Bridge Ministry, Inc.",https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/133,"Mission: The Bridge Ministry exists to alleviate the suffering of underprivileged children, the homeless, and the working poor by providing life-sustaining resources and a message of hope. Services: Church Under the Bridge: This is the original program. Every Tuesday evening for the past 15 years, the food insecure, poor and homeless (ranging from 300 - 500 guests) gather under the Jefferson Street bridge to await the arrival of our two food trailers, two box trucks, and volunteers. The trailers arrive with prepared hot food to be plated; the box trucks are loaded with groceries, clothing, blankets, hygiene items, music equipment, and chairs. As the volunteers arrive (approx. 100 a night) they are assigned to their place of service and the setup begins. Within 30 minutes, the bridge is transformed into a service ministry like no other. Everyone receives a delicious hot meal and participates in a powerful service. At the close of service, we distribute 15,000 – 25,000 pounds of food, clothing, and toiletries to our guests. Bridge to Kids: Several years ago, an elementary school reached out to The Bridge Ministry because many of their students were food insecure. Most of the children who attended were on assisted or fully funded lunch programs and were taking their one little lunch home on Fridays to divide with their brothers, sisters, moms, and dads over the weekend so everyone would have at least a bite of something. We were able to partner with the school to fill each child's backpack with healthy snacks every day and on Fridays, we provide four entrees that go home with these children. Over thirty schools are now in this program and it continues to grow. Bridge to You: Following Nashville’s March 2020 tornado and the onset of the COVID pandemic, the Bridge To You area of ministry evolved to mobilizing our teams to serve hundreds of families and individuals in their own neighborhoods. This is where resources of The Bridge are brought to You, where you are throughout the week. Currently, this program serves at multiple distribution sites throughout the greater Nashville area. Bridge to Community: One joy we get to experience in our work is partnering with other nonprofits and ministries to serve Middle Tennessee.

"Andrew Jackson Police Youth Camp, Inc.",https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/136,"Mission: The Andrew Jackson Police Youth Camp is focused on building community relationships by working with Nashville's underprivileged children in a safe environment in order to positively influence the perception these children have of police officers. The week long curriculum of activities is designed to develop life skills, such as team building and decision making. Another goal is the breaking down of cultural barriers through interaction between police officer camp counselors and these children, giving them a positive vision for their future. Services: Andrew Jackson Police Youth Camp: The lodge operates a summer camp program for underprivileged children at its facility in Wilson County, on Old Hickory Lake. The 35-acre property has been developed into a site that has a pool, bunk house, mess hall, ball field and lake access. The week long curriculum of activities is geared to develop team building and break down cultural barriers. The counselors are all police officers working in conjunction with the city to break the stereotype these children normally have of police officers. The camp serves 300 children per summer, on average. Shop With a Cop: As in the past 18 years, this annual event is held at the Nolensville Road Wal-Mart store. The program provides each child with between $250-$300 to buy much needed clothing, personal items, and gifts for themselves and family members. Funding for the program is provided by the FOP, donations to the FOP Camp, and Wal-Mart itself. 75 - 80 children participate in this event every year.Your brother and sister FOP members from the six summer camps select the kids. From these camps, a list of kids is selected as the ones with the greatest need for help. Once selected, the kids are brought to Wal-Mart by police officers and the officers actually shop with the kids as they pick out gifts for members of their family. When the purchases are made at Wal-Mart, the shoppers are transported to the nearby FOP Lodge Hall where they are able to wrap their gifts and then enjoy lunch provided by Hunt Brothers Pizza. This annual program seems to give the officers and their families a way to give back to the community by helping the ones who would normally not be able to help themselves. The kids are more than thankful for being able to do something for their families.",Youth Development,615-831-2464,,http://www.nashvillefop.org,"440 Welshwood Drive, Nashville, TN 37211, USA",Nashville,TN,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success

In support of these goals, TAADAS secured an advocacy grant from the Healing Trust which will enable stronger more collaborative approaches. TAADAS monitors state and national policies on addictions, co-occurring, prevention, and recovery-support services. If TAADAS determines the treatment and recovery communities are or will be negatively affected by existing or potential legislation or policy initiatives, we strive to reach out to our collaborative partners to address any barriers to service. Often, TAADAS is the voice for those who can no longer speak for themselves or who have simply given up on receiving help for substance use disorder or mental health treatment services.","Advocacy, Drug & Alcohol Treatment",615-780-5901,mail@taadas.org,https://www.taadas.org/,"1321 Murfreesboro Pike suite 155, Nashville, TN 37217, USA",Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon - Fri10:00 AM -  7:00 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

Simultaneously, we seek to dramatically INCREASE the number of locations in Africa that are able to easily grow food as well as collect, clean and store large quantities of rainwater. Services: Grow Bags for Starving Ugandan Villages UGANDAN VILLAGERS ARE STARVING. World Hunger Team is making a difference. We help villages grow their own food. We give them a “Grow Kit.” It has plant bags. It has non-GMO seeds. It has all-natural mineral nutrients. It is a tested & proven SYSTEM. It starts producing food in just 4 weeks. It keeps growing year-round. The people eat fresh greens + veggies. Their diet improves. Their nutrition improves. Their health improves. They smile. How much simpler could it be?

This is an indoor hydroponic growing tent designed for the specific purpose of growing greens and small-bush vegetables. It has a very small “footprint” of just 40” wide by 40” deep, by 80” tall. It uses non-circulating hydroponics (Kratky Method) to grow crops in standing (non-aerated) water. The crops are “fed” with water-soluble all-mineral nutrients, resulting in 100% organic crops. One tent grows up to 108 small plants simultaneously (fewer when growing large-leaf greens or small-bush tomatoes, peppers, etc.) Our Grow Tent is ideal for growing a wide range of leafy crops including lettuce, spinach, kale, Swiss Chard, arugula and more. It also makes it extremely easy to grow your own fresh herbs such as basil, chives, oregano, parsley, dill, lavender and more.

Delivering high-quality programming. ​Championing a life of success for each child. Services: East Nashville Hope Exchange - Summer Program ENHE operates a tuition-free, six-week summer program that focuses on improving reading levels and developing children who are active participants in their family, community, and world. The program incorporates family and community involvement in children’s education. The summer program is open in June and July from Monday – Friday beginning at 8:00 a.m. and ending at 3:00 p.m. Students receive literacy instruction in individualized groups of 3-6 students and participate in activities and projects connected to our theme, ""My Family, My Community, My World."" Each day we have a Guest Reader from the community read a book on our theme, talk to them about their job/role in the community, and emphasize the importance of reading. The program serves approximately 80-100 students, pending funding. ENHE enrolls children in the East Nashville community, in grades Kindergarten-4th. Studies have shown without enrichment opportunities, a child loses approximately 2-3 months of reading achievement during the summer. The children of East Nashville are a good example of what researchers point to when they talk about the “achievement gap” between children from families of means and children in poverty. The children ENHE serves attend schools where an average of 97% of students are from low-income families. East Nashville Hope Exchange - School Year Program In 2013, ENHE augmented its Summer Program with a complimentary School Year Program (SYP). The SYP uses a monthly workshop model designed to help family members support their child(ren) in reaching grade-level reading skills on a long-term basis. The goal of the ENHE School Year Program is to provide literacy training to families and support students’ progress through the school year. The workshops provide concurrent sessions for family members and students as well as a joint session where they can begin implementing the activities addressed in the sessions with the help of workshop leaders. The family sessions focus on how to develop 40 building blocks of healthy development outlined by the Search Institute in The Developmental Assets®, as well as provide hands-on reading activities that family members can do with their children. The 40 assets are research-based positive qualities that influence young people’s development, helping them to succeed in life. In addition to the monthly workshops, ENHE staff interact regularly with families by phone, e-mail, and home visits. With the permission of family, staff will communicate with classroom teachers to monitor student progress. In 2015, ENHE added tutoring supports to its school year program. In the 2018/19 school year, the goal is to increase tutoring support for students who leave our summer program still below grade level proficiency in reading.","Education, Youth Development",615-254-3534,eastnhe@gmail.com,http://www.enhopeexchange.org/,"419 Woodland St, Nashville, Tennessee, United States",Nashville,TN,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success

The other goal is to provide self-help training materials and volunteer assistance to enable an unrepresented individual to present her case to the court. With such assistance, the courts will be better able to reach fair verdicts, with less burden on the court and all of the parties to the lawsuit. It’s a win-win for justice! Health Equity: TJC’s mission to ensure that our laws, policies and programs reflect and honor the value and potential of every human being, regardless of income, age, ability or race, is rooted in the goals of health equity. For over 24 years, TJC has worked to elevate the needs of marginalized groups – including, low-income families, seniors and people with disabilities – and make Tennessee’s policies more just and compassionate. This work must center health equity as its touchstone and confront racism as a systemic barrier to the equitable allocation of resources among different groups. Health equity is achieved when every person, regardless of race, income, education, gender or other demographics, has access to what they need to be as healthy as possible. If there were equitable access to resources, including health care, housing, transportation and food, then a person’s zip code would not be a predictor of their life expectancy. The goal of health equity is to eliminate health disparities, such as higher rates of infant and maternal mortality, higher rates of chronic conditions and lower life expectancy, that are prevalent for people of color and are not due to genetic predispositions.","Advocacy, Justice & Legal Services, Health",615-255-0331,info@tnjustice.org,https://www.tnjustice.org/,"211 7th Ave N ste 100, Nashville, TN 37219, USA",Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon - Fri10:00 AM -  7:00 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

HopeKids Middle Tennessee,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/667,"Mission: HopeKids provides ongoing events, activities and a powerful, unique support community for families who have a child with cancer or some other life-­threatening medical condition. We surround these remarkable children and their families with the message that hope is a powerful medicine. Vision: Our vision, mission and motivation are driven by our desire to serve in the name of Jesus Christ in response to and out of our gratitude to God. (Colossians 3:17) It is through God’s love and the eternal hope we find in Jesus that we want to love and offer hope to those in need. We cling to the promise that “Hope does not disappoint.” (Romans 5:5) We also believe that hope comes from God, and provides joy and peace in a way that nothing else can. These biblical truths form our belief that hope is a powerful medicine, and all our activities, resources, and time are to be directed to restoring hope for the future to the children and families we serve. We strive to promote integrity, honesty, and openness in the manner in which we conduct our daily financial and management operations. We will be good stewards of all resources that God has blessed us with. The HopeKids program is open to all children with life-threatening medical conditions and their families without regard to background, ethnicity, gender, religion, race, or sexual orientation. Services: HopeDay Program One of the most powerful aspects of our work is our HopeDay Program. Each week, we schedule a variety of sporting events, theater shows, concerts, museum visits or other types of fun activities for the whole family. We strive to keep kids focused on the future, looking forward to the next fun event around the corner, rather than dwelling on what they are dealing with in the present. All of our events are focused on the whole family to prevent siblings from being unintentionally overlooked, bring families together who understand their journey, and are offered at no cost to families. HopeCommunity Program HopeKids events work to foster a support community among families who “get it.” Our HopeCommunity program intentionally builds intimate events to bring together families struggling with similar diagnoses or who live in proximity to each other. These events focus on providing opportunities for families to deepen relationships and build a strong support network at a time when they need it most. Support, love, and encouragement are all necessary for families who have a child with cancer or some other life-­threatening medical condition. Our community of children and their families get to know each other, encourage, and support each other. One of the most inspiring moments is when a child who has just been diagnosed with a particular condition meets a child who has been healed from that same condition. Virtual Program Many of our families find themselves isolated due to their child’s medical condition. Families spend weeks and months in the hospital, or have to travel across the country for specialized treatments. This can leave them feeling disconnected and alone during a difficult season. However, through HopeKids’ virtual program, we can bring hope to our families with fun and unique programming, no matter where their circumstances find them. From virtual book clubs to online cooking classes, these events can be attended in the safety of their homes or hospital beds, and connect families like never before. Virtual programming expands the reach of our community beyond each chapter and fosters incredible connections between parents, siblings, and children with life-threatening illnesses. It’s introducing new friends who may never meet in person–but who are bonded in hope–knowing they are not alone.","Children & Family Services, Faith-Based, Health",615-430-9190,deb@hopekids.org,https://www.hopekids.org/,"PO Box 210961, Nashville, TN 37221",Nashville,TN,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success

Artistic expression supports the health, healing and resilience of immigrant communities by lifting up the voice of the people, maintaining identity as central to the movement for equality and dignity. Day laborers and migrants create and frame the narrative surrounding their lives and struggles. In this way, we expand the popular movement on multiple fronts through the engaging nature of cultural production, art as social commentary, and storytelling derived straight from the resilience of the immigrant community.",Advocacy,626) 799-3566,info@ndlon.org,http://ndlon.org/,"1030 South Arroyo Parkway suite 106, Pasadena, California, United States",Pasadena,CA,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success

Operation Song,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/215,"Mission: Operation Song's™ mission is to empower veterans, active duty military, and their family members to tell their stories through the process of songwriting. The ""big idea"" behind Operation Song™ is to help the military community express thoughts and emotions about their service, about themselves, and about their service related issues, illnesses and injuries. We pair professional Nashville songwriters with veterans, service member and their families from WWII to Korea, Vietnam to the Gulf War, Iraq to Afghanistan. We have repeatedly been told by all participants that this is one of the most therapeutic experiences they have had. We are very proud of our track record of success and we are eager to take Operation Song™ to the next level to help fill the growing need for alternative means of expression for our service members and veterans. There has never been, nor will there ever be, any charge for Operation Song's services. Services: 10-Week Songwriting Programs: ""This is therapy on steroids."" Joe E. Vietnam Veteran. In our 10 week program, a group of 4 to 6 veterans meet for 2 hours a week with one or two professional songwriters. The goal is for each veteran to come away with a song that tells their story, what they want the world to know about themselves and their service. The sessions start out with a casual introduction to the process of songwriting and some quick, fun songs are written with each participant. Once the group bonds, individual participants begin telling their stories and the writers help put the ""puzzle pieces"" in place. Other veterans join in, but the final say on content belongs to the one telling the story. By the end of the program, the group has bonded and everyone has a song they can be proud of. The songwriters then do basic recordings of the songs, and a CD is pressed and presented at a closing event for the participants and families. Regular alumni events keep the group connected and engaged in the process of expressing themselves. Songwriting Retreats: ""I accomplished more in those 8 hours than in the 20 shrink sessions I've been to in the last year."" J. Franz, Army Ranger (ret) Iraq. Our weekend retreats feature a Friday night get together with writers, veterans (as many as 12) and sponsors. We have a dinner, then we talk about the program and what to expect, then the songwriters perform some of their hits in an informal setting. The next morning, we pair the writers with veterans and they spend the day writing with a break for lunch. That afternoon, the songs are finished up and basic recordings are made. That evening, after everyone has taken a break, the veterans, their families and the sponsors meet for intimate, acoustic performances of the songs written that day. The veterans and the writers are encouraged to speak and share their feelings about the experience. Over the next few weeks, a CD is made of the songs and presented to the participants. In some cases, this process is condensed to a 1-day process without the loss of quality to the program. Survivors of MST (Military Sexual Trauma) Songwriting Retreat: ""This is my liberation song."" Kate, US Army veteran. During the month of April (Military Sexual Assault Awareness Month) and for the next few months, Operation Song partners with the Women Veterans Health Care Center in Nashville to provide songwriting as therapy to survivors of MST, military sexual trauma. The Center provides the writing space and referrals for the program and Operation Song™ provides songwriters. Most of the songwriters are female but occasionally a veteran will wish to tell her story to a male as part of the recovery process, in which case we oblige. Approximately 10 to 15 women veterans participate each year. Once the songs are written, Operation Song makes recordings of the songs and then has them pressed onto a CD to be given out at a closing event for the participants and their families, always an emotional event. This past year, this event was featured on Nashville and National Pubic Radio on the program, ""Here and Now."" Gold Star Children Songwriting Retreat: Statring in 2017, Operation Song began partnering with A Solider's Child Foundation to put on weekend songwriting camps in Middle TN for Gold Star Children. Groups of 3 or 4 GS children, ages 9-16, sit down with a professional songwriter who helps them to tell their stories. There are suggested topics that the group discusses such as, ""What do I have in common with my fallen parent,"" or ""What would I most like my fallen parent to know about me,"" to get the conversation going. An individual child may break out with a writer to write their specific story as time allows. The GS children then perform the song at the end of the day, always a very moving and impactful event. Military Spouses and Caregivers Songwriting Retreat: “Words cannot express how valuable and precious this experience has been for me. Never through my husband’s military career has anyone asked me to tell my story as a military wife.” We had our first spouses and caregivers retreat in the summer of 2016 and it was very successful. 10 spouses and family members met with songwriters for a one-day retreat. The format was the same as a regular retreat without the Friday night ""meet and greet"" component. This was largely a cost-saving measure but we would like to make it a full weekend in the future. We had such a positive response to the retreat that we hope to have at least two this year, with a goal of quarterly retreats for spouses by 2019.","Arts & Culture, Veteran & Military",844-967-7664,contact@operationsong.org,https://www.operationsong.org/,"P.O.

Southern Alliance for People and Animal Welfare,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/217,"Mission: SAFPAW has a dual mission; that of partnering with those who are homeless & those who are housed but live at or below the poverty level and their companion animals. For the animals our most critical program is our weekly Spay/Neuter transport that is free of charge to those we serve. We pick up all over Nashville, and bring each animal back fixed, completely vaccinated, dewormed, treated for fleas, and with a bag of pet food plus the paperwork & rabies tag. We also assist with yearly vaccines plus minor veterinary care, pet food, collars & leashes plus food/water bowls. For the people we assist our main program is Perian's Place, our post-recovery house for women. Currently we house 3, however this year we are hoping to move (with financial partnership) from our current location to a larger house in the Madison area. Our current SAFPAW/Perian's Place is paid for, so your donations will allow us to sell this place and put the proceeds from the sale of our current place into a property that will help even more animals and people. SAFPAW/Perian's Place also fosters animals surrendered to us and once in our care they are fixed & vaccinated and then enter into the adoption program of one of our rescue partners. The women living at Perian's Place assist in their care along with volunteers. Women live here for up to 2 years, rent free for the first 2 months. After that rent is only $50 a month. They must either work part time or be on disability, and also work on their recovery, attend classes as they may be directed, and work towards permanent housing with our assistance. We also assist people experiencing homelessness in recovering their 3 forms of ID; State ID, Social Security Card and Birth Certificate. SAFPAW also provides camping supplies, bus passes & fast food gift cards as they are available, we also have a pet food pantry as well as offering basic pet care supplies. Services: Homeless Pet Owner Outreach: We provide pet care for homeless pet owners as well as pet owners housed but living in poverty. This includes spay/neuter, basic veterinary care, pet food and other necessary pet supplies. SAFPAW runs a weekly spay/neuter transport that is free of charge for those we serve, and we have for 18 years. We go to homeless camps, homeless hotels, subsidized housing (MDHA) and the streets to meet pet owners and pick their animal up early in the morning, dropping them off at our veterinary partner, Animal House, then bringing them back that early evening with their paperwork and a bag of pet food. This is one of our most sought after programs, and stays full each week. Helping animals, helping people. Our SAFPAW weekly spay/neuter & wellness transport that is free for the pet owners we serve continues to be our most sought after program. Every week we go to camps, motels, low income housing and anywhere those we serve may be staying and pick up their dog or cat, we deliver them to Animal House Veterinary Clinic (our primary vet partner) and pick them up that same evening and return them with the paperwork, tag, and a bag of pet food. The animals are spayed or neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, treated for fleas and other minor veterinary issues that we may find while the animal is at the clinic. SAFPAW has opened Perian's Place, a post-recovery house for women off the streets and who have completed detox & rehab. Here they can live for up to 2 years, rent free for 2 months and then only $50 a month. They must work at least part time or be on disability. We also house foster animals that have been surrendered to SAFPAW, getting them ready to join one of our animal adoption partners, so the women care for those animals while they are in our care as part of their house duties. In addition, these 2 years are to serve as a home they are safe in, sober in, and they attend recovery classes as directed while living with us. In addition we also continue to help anyone homeless to recover their 3 forms of ID; State ID, Social Security card and Birth Certificate so that they can apply for housing.

A cappella is enjoying resurgence in popularity through network TV programs like Glee and The Sing-Off.

Tennesseans for Alternatives to the Death Penalty,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/272,"Mission: Tennesseans for Alternatives to the Death Penalty (TADP) seeks to honor life by abolishing the death penalty in Tennessee. TADP works to accomplish this mission by educating Tennesseans about the problems with the death penalty system and empowering citizens to act for change. Services: Sharing Our Stories Sharing Our Stories is an innovative program pairing TADP staff with surviving family members of murder victims, death row exonerees, corrections officials, and families of the executed to provide presentations to faith communities, schools, and organizations. This program allows those most directly impacted by this policy to share their stories about the broken death penalty system. TADP empowers these individuals through speaking engagements and events specifically organized to offer support to those who have been directly impacted by the death penalty. Leadership Development TADP has developed several workshops designed to educate and empower citizens with the basic tools to organize themselves and advocate for their own interests. The training workshops include public speaking and citizen advocacy. Student Conference on the Death Penalty High school and college students from across the state gather at a college or university to attend the annual Student Conference on the Death Penalty. During this day-long conference, students hear from those directly impacted by the death penalty system and receive training on how to educate students and faculty on their respective campuses. Tennessee Conservatives Concerned about the Death Penalty Conservatives in Tennessee are taking a stand to re-evaluate the current capital punishment system. Polls show that national support for the death penalty has steadily decreased over the past two decades and has reached a 40-year low, even among conservatives who have traditionally been strong proponents of capital punishment. Our state continues to spend millions of dollars a year on an unpopular punishment that has been used 11 times since 1960. The 2004 Tennessee Comptroller’s “Tennessee’s Death Penalty: Costs and Consequences” report revealed that death penalty trials cost an average of 48 percent more than the average cost of trials in which prosecutors seek life imprisonment. The death penalty fails at both efficiency and results. Tennessee Conservatives Concerned about the Death Penalty (TNCC) provides a platform for Tennessee conservatives to question this system marked by inefficiency, inequity, and inaccuracy and to educate other conservatives statewide about this failed policy that doesn't make us safer, risks executing the innocent, and is wasteful and expensive. Tennessee Alliance for the Severe Mental Illness Exclusion (TASMIE) Working with the TASMIE coalition, TADP educates Tennesseans about the human and financial costs of pursuing the death penalty for those who have severe mental illness and why these individuals should not be eligible for a death sentence. Recognizing the need for public safety, life without parole would still be an option for these violent offenders, but with death off the table, victims' families will be provided legal finality much sooner, and the state will save millions of dollars that can be used for mental health treatment, compensation for victims' families, and additional resources for law enforcement. TADP Shelby County Initiative Through a community organizer, this initiative will educate and create awareness about the impact of the criminal justice system in Shelby County, and, as part of a collaboration with Just City, will serve as the primary vehicle for TADP in Memphis. This collaborative work will support Just City and TADP in achieving their common goals of reducing the size, scope, and disparate treatment within the criminal justice system.","Advocacy, Inmate & Formerly Incarcerated",615-256-3906,info@tennesseedeathpenalty.org,https://tennesseedeathpenalty.org,"P.O.

NeedLink Nashville,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/306,"Mission: NeedLink Nashville helps our neighbors meet their most basic needs in times of crisis by providing short-term assistance and links to other resources. Services: Emergency Utility Assistance NeedLink’s utility assistance program has helped Nashvillians since 1912. Our organization began as ""Big Brothers"" and provided firewood, loads of coal, and tins of heating oil to keep our neighbors warm. Food baskets were delivered to those in need. Over time NeedLink began working with those needing emergency assistance with unforeseen expenses affecting utility continuance and rent payments. In Nashville today, high living costs make it difficult to save, so an unexpected car repair, a health issue, or a lay-off can spark a financial crisis. Utility bills go unpaid, a cut-off notice arrives, but there is just not enough money to stay afloat.The need greatly outpaces available resources. Approximately 7000 requests are received each year now, NeedLink is generally able to help 35% to 40% of our the clients We also worked to bring homeless Nashvillians into housing. NeedLink Program Directors personally consult with all the families seeking assistance enabling them to benefit from the services available through NeedLink, but also guiding them to additional resources available in Nashville. 3500 such referrals were made last year involving more than 60 NeedLink Partners.A household is eligible assistance once every 12 months, and all payments are made directly to utility companies or landlords. We target payments for maximum benefit and provide resource counseling that helps sustain housing stability. Holiday Food Boxes Since 1912, volunteers from across Nashville have gathered to package and deliver food to low-income families and seniors. Last year, NeedLink’s annual food box delivery supplied 200 low-income households with staples like spaghetti, rice, beans, and peanut butter, along with fresh fruit and vegetables.For those struggling to make ends meet, a full kitchen refrigerator and cupboard restores a level of comfort during the holidays. Some recipients tell us the food box enables them to invite family for a holiday dinner. Many are appreciative of extra food while their children are home on winter break. Others, especially seniors, are simply grateful that someone remembered them at the holidays. Emergency Rental Assistance Rents for small apartments in Nashville have risen sharply in recent years. Many seniors families in affordable rental homes have been displaced as two houses are constructed in the place of the one where they lived. It's nearly impossible for seniors living on a fixed income, families working low-wage jobs, and people with disabilities to get by without a little bit of help. Even ""affordable"" housing rents can be difficult to keep up with for those working part-time jobs with unpredictable hours or living on a fixed income. NeedLink's rental assistance program helps people living in income-based housing, who are most at risk of becoming homeless if evicted. We also assist people with deposit costs that help them obtain income-based housing when they have previously been homeless, doubled up, living in motel rooms or in their cars. NeedLink continues to increase funding for this program, and is dedicating $70,000 to helping people get into and maintain housing. . Because the need continues to outpace our available resources, we partner with other homelessness prevention and rehousing partners throughout the city to make sure people can access the program that will best address their particular needs.","Housing & Homelessness, Hunger & Food Security, Human & Social Services",615-269-6835,info@needlink.org,https://www.needlink.org/,"1600 56th Avenue North, Nashville, TN 37209, USA",Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon12:00 PM -  4:00 PM  (EDT); Tue12:00 PM -  4:00 PM  (EDT); WedClosed; ThuClosed; FriClosed; SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

Visitation Clinic is a ""green"" facility. We are located in Petite Riviere de Nippes and serve over 300,000 people who would otherwise have little access to health care. Cholera Treatment Program Since the outbreak of cholera in 2011, Visitation Clinic has hosted and helped manage a Cholera Treatment Unit that is adjacent to our main clinic building. The CTU has been operated in parternship with a Belgium charity and has treated over 400 patients in 2011 saving many lives.

Safe shelter, meals, counseling, parenting classes for the moms, and homework help for the children are all available.

They also attend daily classes in life skills, money management, or Bible study. There's a graduation ceremony for those who complete the program, and then they can move on to employment, transitional housing, HOPE Program, or Overcomers.

"Christian Community Services, Inc.",https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/409,"Mission: CCSI's mission is to equip and empower underserved families, through caring relationships, to achieve a legacy of social, spiritual, and economic self-sufficiency. Vision: CCSI emphasizes the importance of communities and families living in harmony, making positive choices, and taking personal responsibility for one’s beliefs, attitudes and actions. Althoguht faith inspires CCSI’s work and spiritual development is part of its mission, there is no religious expectation or requirement. All are welcome. Services: Economic Empowerment CCSI currently offers three programs: Basic Financial Training (BFT), Mentoring Towards Independence (MTI), and First-Time Homebuyer Education. The programs differ in focus and intensity, but each has economic empowerment as a central theme. The financial literacy components of our services are based on curricula that have defined industry standards. Basic Financial Training (BFT) BFT is an 8 hour, financial literacy workshop that was created as an eviction prevention resource for residents of their Hope VI communities. The workshop highlights the fundamentals of money management: budgeting and “smart” spending; saving; managing bank accounts; credit/debt; and financial preparation for pursuing higher education or specialized training, homeownership, small business start-up, etc. Today, BFT serves people regardless of their incomes, however, the majority of participants are lower-income families. Since the program began, almost 100% of participants had household incomes less than 60% of the area’s median income. Each session has the capacity to serve 25 families. To graduate, participants must attend the session, create a realistic household budget, complete all assignments, and pass the post test. BFT is typically offered three times per year. Mentoring Towards Independence (MTI) MTI was CCSI’s original flagship program, which is now offered to BFT graduates with annual household incomes between 100-200% of the federal poverty guidelines. The MTI program typically accepts about 15-20 families and they are paired with volunteer mentors who attend classes with the participants and are in contact at least once a week outside of class. Volunteer food teams provide the weekly meals, and tutors meet with the children for homework assistance and curriculum implementation. P.A.S.S. (Children's Program) MTI includes a children’s component, which we call P.A.S.S. (Personal Academic, Social, and Spiritual). It was added to take advantage of the 9 months we have with MTI participants’ children. The goal is to facilitate positive development, and create an experience to support journeys of growth and change for the children similar to their parents. Infants and older engage in activities that promote age appropriate social and emotional as well as academic and economic development and readiness. Students in grades 1-12 are involved in curricula that mirrors their parents, to reinforce the economic, social , emotional, and spiritual aspects of a healthy and well-balanced life. First-Time Homebuyer Education (Pre Purchase) First Time Homebuyer Education (HBE) is an 8-hour workshop that focuses on the financial and legal aspects of owning a home and provides insight about what first-timers can expect throughout the home-buying process.","Faith-Based, Housing & Homelessness, Human & Social Services",(615) 297-4024,info@ccsinashville.org,https://www.ccsinashville.org/,"601 Benton Avenue, Nashville, TN 37204, USA",Nashville,TN,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success

Most of the backpacks are distributed in Middle Tennessee, but some have made their way to 38 other states. The gift of a backpack to a person who is homeless also develops trust and conversation.

Council on Aging of Greater Nashville,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/62-1867122,"Mission: AgeWell Middle TN champions informed and positive aging and serves as the area's catalyst for collaborative solutions. Vision: We believe that as more of us live longer, we have an exciting opportunity to reimagine our community to ensure we can age well. We are committed to embracing aging and enhancing community by being a trusted resource, a catalyst for solutions to unmet needs and a champion for older adults. Services: Caregiver Education, Support & Information/Referral & Directory of Services AgeWell provides trusted information on healthcare, housing, transportation, help at home, and more. We offer four critical resource guidebooks and community education. • The Directory of Services for Older Adults - the only comprehensive, impartial resource guide for older adults in Middle TN, the 22nd edition was published in January 2023 and 20,000+ copies distributed. • Aging & Caring: A Guide for Families and Caregivers - designed to help individuals who are embarking on the caregiving journey think through important issues with their aging loved one(s). • Empowering Grandparents: A Guide for Grandparents Raising Grandchildren - offers vital information and support for grandparents caring for grandchildren. • Preparing and Planning for Life's Final Chapter - contains practical considerations for end-of-life care options, and guidance on communicating with doctors, family members, and friends. Elder Abuse & Scam Prevention AgeWell continues to host meetings of the Middle TN Elder Watch, the local affiliate of the Tennessee Vulnerable Adults Coalition. In 2016, members helped create, print, and distribute hundreds of “pocket guides” for medical, financial, and law enforcement professionals. AgeWell also continues the “Scam of the Month” email blast, reaching over a thousand seniors and professionals each month. Older adults are very concerned about being the victim of a scam, so AgeWell has updated our scam prevention brochure and conducts community education across Middle Tennessee. Sage Awards AgeWell's vision is a community where the wisdom, knowledge, skills, and experience of older adults are respected and valued. One way we live out this vision is by honoring older adults with AgeWell's Sage Awards. These outstanding individuals and couples are nominated by peers because they have demonstrated a lifelong commitment to improving the quality of life in their community. Livable Communities As a catalyst for innovative solutions and advocate for older adults, we have been engaging with universities, nonprofits, government agencies, and faith communities to advance creative solutions for the affordable housing crisis. We're pleased to report that after working with Mayor Cooper's affordable housing team and other community advocates, Nashville has allocated funding to create and launch a home-sharing pilot program in 2023. Intergenerational home sharing matches older homeowners who have a spare bedroom with graduate students (or other adults) who need affordable rent. Rent can be an important source of supplemental income for older homeowners, and shared living fosters intergenerational and often intercultural connections. The long-term goal is to create a more age-friendly community that brings generations together to reduce isolation and improve economic security. Eldercare Initiative for Employers Caregivers in today's health and economic crisis are either working from home or unemployed and caring for children and/or aging relatives. The number of caregivers of older adults in the U.S. has increased by 10 million over the past five years. Tennessee ranks 49th in the country for family caregiver support (Caring.com Best and Worst Family Caregiver Rankings). This abysmal ranking underscores the need for better policies and practices that ease the burden on Middle Tennessee caregivers. AgeWell is responding to this need through Eldercare Coach, a social enterprise that helps local businesses assess employees' caregiving needs and offers employees online resources, group training/Lunch and Learn, discussions, and personalized 'care coach' phone consultations for emotional support and resource navigation assistance. We officially launched Eldercare Coach in 2022.",Seniors,615-353-4235,info@agewelltn.org,http://www.agewelltn.org,"3511 Belmont Blvd, Nashville, TN, United States",Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon11:00 AM -  4:00 PM  (EDT); Tue11:00 AM -  5:00 PM  (EDT); Wed11:00 AM -  4:00 PM  (EDT); Thu11:00 AM -  4:00 PM  (EDT); Fri11:00 AM -  4:00 PM  (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

Mighty Writers,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/1124,"Mission: Think clearly and write with clarity is our battle cry, our tagline, our mantra. It's served as our mission statement since our launch in 2009. Not everyone — as is so strikingly apparent of late — thinks clearly. And even fewer people express themselves with clarity. But for those who nail both clarity of thought and expression, a lifetime of Mightiness is available for the taking. We're believers in the power of writing. But when COVID-19 began to strangle our Mighty communities, our mission suddenly needed amending. You can't think or write with clarity if you're hungry. We began by distributing lunches to kids. The lunch numbers grew quickly, so we began distributing boxes of groceries and hot meals. Books, too, of course, and Tootsie Pops, a pretty sweet combo, FYI. As for teaching kids to write, we wouldn't dare let slip our once-and-forever mission. When the virus took hold, we whisked kids from our centers and hightailed it out of there. We learned Zoom, scouted writing platforms, updated our MW kids and families about next steps, and airlifted Mighty Writers to a safe spot in the online universe. We launched a roster of ""at-home"" classes. Our Mighty Writer regulars were happy when we announced a roster that included workshops on mindfulness, Girl Power!, Brotherhood and Teenish, big favorites 'round here. Our Mighty world, like yours, was upended by COVID. Our best bet is always to make sure MW kids stay safe while we work on new ways to serve the families and children who so graciously allow us into their communities. Thank you for always being there when we need you most. Services: Each year at Mighty Writers we teach more than 4,500 kids to think clearly and write with clarity so they can achieve success. We host writing workshops in Philadelphia, in Chester County, PA, and in Camden, Atlantic City and Newark, NJ.

Diversity: We value and celebrate differences in race, culture, religion, age, and identity. We believe that mothers are united in our desire to nurture understanding and empathy in our children. When we embrace our differences and are exposed to new experiences and cultures, we can grow awareness and understanding within ourselves, our kids, and our communities. We can also begin to break down barriers to racial equality and plant seeds to cultivate a more just future for our children. MOMCODE commits to actively listening to voices from different backgrounds and promoting diversity in all aspects of our programming. We strive to ensure all of our members feel heard and supported. Empowerment: We help moms grow stronger and more confident as both parents and individuals. We strive to assist mothers to find balance and ensure the health and wellbeing of their families.

Teen Initiatives Studio NPL: Out-of-school learning experiences for middle and high school students are crucial for readying teens for college, the workforce and beyond. Through Studio NPL, the library is able to provide a nurturing space for teens to develop key talents and skills with support from friends and guidance from expert mentors. With access to sophisticated technology and media, teens are able to work outside the bounds of school curricula to develop their passions and turn them into educational, economic and life skills opportunities. Studio NPL’s four areas of concentration are music, writing, gaming and making. Students use the space to immerse themselves in a variety of hands-on, problem-solving activities and develop web literacy, digital skills and 21st century competencies key to higher education, employment and life-long success. Studio NPL consists of fixed and mobile learning environments. The Main Library houses the satellite studio while five smaller studio spaces exist at select library branches. In addition, a mobile unit will extend the Studio’s reach to public schools, community centers and other organizations with limited resources. ____ Limitless Libraries: Imagine students sitting in their school libraries with access to all the books and periodicals they could possibly need—from the latest fiction to today’s New York Times. The Nashville Public Library, with the support of the Mayor and Metro Nashville Public Schools, has made this dream a reality. Through Limitless Libraries, all 84,000 K-12 students in 128 Metro public schools can access the more than 1.5 million books in the NPL collection and have them delivered to their school libraries. This once ambitious initiative, designed to transform underfunded and outdated public school libraries into world class collections, has become a sought after program that increases literacy levels, discourages aliteracy and even prevents students from dropping out of school.

Westminster Home Connection,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/483,"Mission: Most older adults and persons with disabilities prefer the dignity of aging in place in their own home. Westminster Home Connection makes repairs and mobility modifications, which empower older adults and persons with disabilities to age-in-place safely, and with dignity. We make homes safer, more functional, and ensure the home can be retained in the local affordable housing stock. According to the Social Security Administration, 25% of older adults rely on Social Security for most of their income. Our clients’ average monthly household income is less than $1,500. With such modest financial resources, most are unable to pay for essential mobility modifications, or costly repairs like roof or HVAC replacements. Relatively simple repairs like plumbing leaks often go unattended, causing the home to deteriorate into conditions unsuitable for habitation. In cooperation with the client and their case manager, Westminster assesses each home to ensure clients can live with dignity in a safer and more functional home. Services: Critical Home Repairs Critical Home Repairs: Roofs: Repair leaks, truss or decking damage, and replace worn out roofs Soffits, Fascia & Gutters: Repair or replace HVAC: Provide heated & cooled living space Structural: Repair joists & subfloors Electrical: Eliminate fire hazards and shock dangers, upgrade receptacles Plumbing: Repair active leaks, replace or repair toilets, non-working faucets, fixtures, sinks and sump pumps, replace water heaters, repair water mains Carpentry: Repair or replace flooring, doors, trim, walls, windows and decks Pest treatment: Termites, roaches, ants Hazard: Provide fire extinguishers, install smoke detectors, & change batteries Mobility Modifications Mobility modifications are made to homes of persons with limited mobility.

For example, we can modify a bathtub into a step-in bath for less than $1,000, and trained volunteers build 12 – 15 wheelchair ramps each year for the cost of materials and construction supervision. Sort, Pack, Move Sort household contents and reduce clutter. Pack, move and unpack household items into a new home that meets the needs of senior individuals or couples. There is a dire need among many older adults who are almost trapped by clutter and the accumulation of ""things"". The senior may be physically unable to do the work. In other cases, they need a compassionate person to merely help sort and organize their belongings. We match older adults with patient and caring volunteers. Because Sort, Pack & Move services are heavily dependent on volunteers, the budget is only $25,000. Using the Independent Sector’s valuation, the monetary value of volunteerism for all Westminster programs exceeded $75,000 in 2017.","Disability Services, Faith-Based, Seniors",(615) 693-2153,info@westminsterhomeconnection.org,https://www.westminsterhomeconnection.org/,"3900 West End Avenue, Nashville, TN 37205, USA",Nashville,TN,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success

The TSMP is committed to providing meaningful mitigation by improving in-stream and riparian habitat and overall water quality. The TSMP uses the principles of natural channel design and process-based methodologies, to identify and develop stream restoration projects statewide. The program uses a watershed approach to complete large-scale restoration projects. Working with private landowners, non-profit organizations, municipalities as well as state and federal agencies, the TSMP funds projects on significantly degraded streams to arrest bank erosion, improve water quality and restore aquatic and riparian habitat. Tennessee Outdoors Youth Summit (TOYS) Students are introduced to many outdoor activities including boating, hunting, trapping, archery, photography, marksmanship, plant identification, forestry, camping, water quality, trap & skeet shooting, wildlife identification, and several classes with wildlife and fisheries biology as the topic. They will participate in hands-on classes that will teach the importance of natural resources and management. Instructors are wildlife and fisheries biologists, wildlife officers, college professors, professional shooting coaches, and experts from fields of interest. Classes are 2-4 hours long. Once the students are accepted in the program, they will be able to attend at least 10 classes of their choice during the week. Many of these classes will provide certification for the students on the particular skills that are learned. Students that are interested in a career in the natural resources field will also enjoy the experiences that normally are not learned until you join the work force. Hatchie River Wetland Mitigation Bank In 2007, the TWRF purchased 685-acres of prior-converted property along Big Muddy Creek in Haywood County, TN. The site had been cleared, ditched, leveed and converted to agriculture in the late 1960s. Working with state and federal resource agencies, the TWRF developed a plan to restore the site and establish a wetland mitigation bank. The TWRF restored the site in 2008-2009 by removing the levees, filling the ditches and planting thousands of native bottomland hardwood trees. Today the site is on the road to recovery. Once again functioning as natural wetland, the site now provides a myriad of water-quality benefits and valuable wildlife habitat. The ecological success of the project will be documented through a seven-year monitoring period. Once the bank is closed, the TWRF will transfer ownership of the property to TWRA. Through TWRF’s efforts, future generations of Tennessee’s sportsmen will be able to enjoy this unique resource the wildlife habitat provides.","Environment, Youth Development",615-831-9311,info@twrf.net,https://twrf.net/,"5000 Linbar Drive suite 275, Nashville, TN 37211, USA",Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon - Fri10:00 AM -  7:00 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

TKF's vision is a Tennessee where the rate of kidney disease is minimized and everyone who needs care receives care. Services: Emergency Assistance Program The Emergency Assistance Program provides funds to help those affected by kidney disease with any expenses related directly or indirectly to end stage renal disease and transplantation. Individuals may request assistance for rent, mortgage, utilities, medication, food, emergency transportation and medical equipment as well as other basic needs.

Each screening consists of an intake form to determine personal and family history of kidney-related health issues, hypertension and diabetes, a blood pressure reading, Body Mass Index (BMI) calculation, and urinalysis. TKF offers a volunteer physician or nurse practitioner to speak one on one with each participant at the end of the screening to provide TKF educational resources and encouragement for seeking follow-up care with a primary care physician as needed.

Tennessee Lions Charities Inc,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/499,"Mission: Tennessee Lions Charities was formed in 1995 with the mission of improving the vision of preschool-age children. In support of this mission, we partnered with Vanderbilt University’s Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences to develop the KidSight Outreach vision screening program. KidSight Outreach vision screenings provide early detection of potential vision problems which are treatable before a child enters kindergarten, removing an obstacle that could have hampered the early stages of their educational, social, and personal development. Services: KidSight Outreach Trained volunteers conduct eye screenings of young children to identify, for treatment, potential vision problems. Screenings are conducted at Head Start programs, day care centers, kindergartens, and other locations where children are supervised on a regular basis. Findings are interpreted by medical professionals and parents are notified of results. Our program consists of three interdependent parts: an organizational structure, field protocol governing the use of the screening instrument, and assured follow-up. Once treated, the cognitive, social and emotional aspects of the child will vastly improve. Early identification and professional vision care of young children can allow them to begin school with good sight and the opportunity to learn up to their potential.

The Beat of Life,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/554,"Mission: To create songwriting programs for Nashville’s most vulnerable, challenged, and hurting populations... pairing the critical social issues of our time with the power of music. Services: Redemption Songs Redemption Songs provides therapeutic healing music programs to the staff and inmates of Davidson County Corrections facilities, with the eventual expansion to serve jails, prisons, and juvenile detention facilities throughout Middle TN. Music is a powerful resource and can assist in the attainment of rehabilitation and re-socialization among inmate populations. Music helps inmates “survive the sentence” as well as assist corrections staff in better relating to and communicating with the inmates and provide a therapeutic outlet for the stress of the job. In addition to the songwriting, instrument lessons, band and choir formation, and other forms of music group and individual sessions for inmates and staff, we will hold concerts within the walls of the correctional institutions each year. Sing it to Stop It Sing it to Stop it! is a partnership with the school systems in Middle Tennessee to provide a proactive and creative way to prevent bullying and promote civility, tolerance, and compassion. Songwriting workshops featuring two professional/hit songwriters are held in classrooms, Grades 1-12. Each classroom is tasked with creating a song as a group, encompassing the anti-bullying theme. Workshops are built around a competition per school to determine which class can create the “winning” song. Students are taught how to sing, write, and arrange a song together, while expressing their thoughts on ‘bullying’ and its effects. Each workshop follows a basic structure: a pre-writing activity, a brainstorming session for content, and finally, writing a finished song. The structure offers individual and team work as the students evaluate their own progress and support their peers. Beautiful Minds Launched in June 2015, Beautiful Minds is designed to serve adults and teens battling depression, suicide and mental illness. Our inaugural event was held at The Center for Living and Learning in Franklin, TN, and several additional programs are planned this year in mental health centers throughout Middle Tennessee. During this program each participant is paired with a songwriter who helps them share their personal stories and struggles through song. Songs are then recorded and shared with whomever the participant chooses with a plan to produce a compilation CD and video featuring each song. Current research into the impact that music therapy has on individuals facing depression and mental illness indicates that those who engage in therapy exhibit both significantly improved self-esteem and reduced depression but also demonstrate marked improvement in communication and interactive skills (Queens University Belfast, 2014.) Writing their story through song validates each participant’s experience and can serve as a catalyst for a greater understanding of both the challenges they personally face and the healing potential of authentic partnership.","Arts & Culture, Inmate & Formerly Incarcerated, Youth Development",615-957-6324,info@thebeatoflife.org,http://thebeatoflife.org/,"100 Taylor St ste b4, Nashville, TN 37208, USA",Nashville,TN,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success

It's one of the largest and most successful youth shooting programs in the nation: 2,100 youth annually; 90 active teams across the state; 19% girls and 81% boys competing head to head; 127 national medals won since 2005. In program surveys, 70% said the program taught them the importance of wildlife conservation. Hunters for the Hungry Through Hunters for the Hungry, the Federation provides funding to certified wild game processors so they can receive and process donated venison, which is then given to local hunger relief programs such as food banks and soup kitchens. We work with over 70 participating processors in 63 counties and collect an average of 140,000 pounds of venison annually. This venison is a lean protein source that meets the needs of hunger relief agencies across the state. In addition to hunters donating all or part of their harvests, school clubs can participate in a variety of ways through a program called Hunger Challenge. These students contribute hundreds of volunteer hours, thousands of dollars, and tens of thousands of meals. Our Hunters for the Hungry program has donated 2 million pounds of venison since the program began in 1998, equaling 8.2 million meals. Conservation Policy Conservation Policy has always been at the core of our work. The Federation was founded over 70 years ago when sportsmen and wildlife lovers banded together to build the agencies and policies that moved our state's wildlife from teetering on the edge to a treasure that gives people reasons to go outside. Our robust policy team is presently addressing legislation spanning from securing federal funding for non-game wildlife management to fighting the invasive Asian carp.

Youth Villages,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/600,"Mission: Youth Villages helps children and families live successfully. Youth Villages is a national leader in children’s mental and behavioral health. Founded in 1986, the organization helps more than 36,000 children annually through programs that involve intensive work with the child and family, as well as a focus on measuring outcomes; keeping children in the community whenever safely possible; and providing accountability to families and funders. With locations across the U.S., Youth Villages’ continuum of programs includes intensive in-home services; residential treatment; foster care and adoption; LifeSet for transition-age youth; mentoring; and crisis services. The organization has been recognized by the Harvard Business School and U.S. News & World Report and was identified by The White House as one of the nation’s most promising results-oriented nonprofit organizations. Services: Adoption and Foster Care The Youth Villages adoption program works to find permanent homes for the children in our care who have adoption as a goal. The Youth Villages Foster Care program supports foster parents and works to match them with children who need a loving, supportive home. Intercept Intensive In-Home Therapy Our intensive in-home treatment programs provide help for troubled teenagers, children, and families in their own homes at times convenient for the families. Youth Villages offers two intensive in-home treatment programs: Intercept and Multisystemic Therapy® (MST®). Residential Treatment Programs Youth Villages’ residential treatment programs serve boys and girls with serious to severe emotional and behavioral problems combined with other needs. Although placement criteria vary for each campus, the programs accept adolescents and teens with IQ scores of 45 or above. Almost 95% of those admitted have multiple presenting issues. LifeSet At the edge of adulthood, choices about education, employment, relationships and health can be overwhelming. LifeSet is a proven method for helping young adults get it right. Since 1999, LifeSet has helped provide the most vulnerable young people with the support they need to realize their own amazing potential. LifeSet has been refined and tested and refined some more, but it all begins with one simple tenet: We believe in the potential of every single kid to become an incredible adult.A successful transition to adulthood includes maintaining stable and suitable housing, remaining free from legal involvement, participating in an educational/vocational program and developing the life skills necessary to become a responsible citizen. Youth Villages’ LifeSet program works not only with former foster youth and other vulnerable young people but also with their support systems to help ensure a more successful transition. These kids can do it. We know this. It’s up to us to step up and make sure that every kid has the opportunity to Get Ready. Get Set. For Life. Mentoring Studies show that children who have at least one consistent, caring adult in their lives are less likely to drop out of school or get in trouble with law enforcement, and are better prepared to build good relationships with their own families than those without that positive influence. You can become a powerful, positive force in the life of a child with emotional and behavioral problems. Become a mentor and you can do more than just befriend a child in Youth Villages’ care in Tennessee or Georgia – you might become the first positive role model that child has ever had. Multisystemic Therapy (MST) MST is built on the principle and scientific evidence that a seriously troubled child’s behavioral problems are multidimensional and must be confronted using multiple strategies. The serious behavior problems of a child typically stem from a combination of influences, including family factors, deviant peer groups, problems in school or the community, and individual characteristics. The MST model calls for simultaneously addressing all of those inter-related areas. New Allies Across the country, child welfare leaders are tasked with protecting children, supporting families and bringing positive change to entrenched systems with large bureaucracies. We know that our communities are stronger when all children have a chance to grow up in stable, permanent families and are able to reach their full potential as adults. Too often, frequent crises, public scrutiny and limited capacity force leaders to direct resources to short-term urgent needs, rather than long-term improvement. We’re bringing New Allies to help leaders in states and counties navigate long-term system transformation. Memphis Allies A bold initiative to reduce gun violence and ensure safe neighborhoods in Memphis and Shelby County, so that children and families can thrive and reach their full potential. A collaborative approach, Memphis Allies seeks to reach the youth and adults with the highest risk of involvement in gun violence and redirect them to the appropriate services.","Children & Family Services, Human & Social Services, Youth Development",901-251-5000,news@youthvillages.org,http://www.youthvillages.org/,"3320 Brother Boulevard, Memphis, TN 38133, USA",Memphis,TN,Closed; Mon10:30 AM -  7:00 PM  (EDT); Tue11:00 AM -  7:00 PM  (EDT); Wed10:30 AM -  7:00 PM  (EDT); Thu11:00 AM -  7:00 PM  (EDT); Fri10:30 AM -  7:00 PM  (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

Having said that, we can work with you to make sure your donations meet your needs and honor your wishes, even when donor discretion is requested. If you have a cause or have a need, we can help you accept donations for that cause. We are proud to say that because we are small and made up of volunteers, over 97 percent of your donation goes to your cause. Services: VETERANS We want to thank our Veterans for their service by giving back to help with their needs. We have paired with Warrior Expeditions to help them with their missions. We look forward to helping other veterans groups as well. We are working to pair with TADSAW in Texas to pair veterans living in Middle Tennessee with a service dog. They are able to work with trainers in the area at an affordable cost of $2,500 to train each dog. They can either locate a dog for the vet or possibly use the veteran's dog, if it meets certain criteria. This program not only helps veteran's, but they also use rescue dogs to train, so they also give rescue dogs a home. EDUCATION We are looking to help students reach their academic potential. One goal of ours is to teach students how to write grants to our nonprofit that will provide funding for extra-curricular activities at their school. We want to empower students at schools to share in their school's success by providing seminar's on how to write grants and then accept, review and award grants to help fund extra-curricular activities that are often cut due to mandatory budget cuts. This will serve two goals, one is to help students write grants and we know that being a good writer is a critical skill to future success, and two, it will provide extra-curricular activities for students to help them develop skills that may not always be provided in a typical school's curriculum. For example, for a school to put on a play, they have to usually pay copyright fees on top of costs to put on the play, such as costume costs, prop or scene building materials, lighting, etc. Another example is Science Olympiad materials are also very expensive and often prohibit schools and/or students from participating. iGive Foundation hopes to help improve student writing and help schools provide extra-curricular activities that are important to a students academic development.

Our short-term goal on an individual case level is to ensure that individuals are able to remain with their families to support and sustain themselves while they fight for their right to remain in this country. We do this by providing direct representation to those who have been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to request affordable bonds. Once a person is out of detention, they have increased access to the immigration system. Programmatic short-term goals include representing as many people as possible in immigration court with a focus on family unity and identifying opportunities for outreach and presentations to educate and engage at-risk communities in order to prevent issues with immigration. Long-term goals on an individual case level is to provide long-term representation to clients throughout the life of their case. Along the way, clients are often eligible for work authorization and require support for life changes. We represent a client throughout their process with the ultimate goal of gaining lawful status in this country. Programmatic long-term goals include establishing our reputation across immigrant communities in the Mid-South as a trusted agency to reach out to for help. Moreover, as we assist on individual cases, we can identify patterns of injustice in the immigration system and strive to improve the system through strategic litigation, advocacy through professional associations, and participation in regional and national networks. We measure impact in quantitatively, keeping track of the number of clients for whom we provide advice, direct representation and what outcomes were attained. We also measure the number of people in a family who have benefited from our representation of a parent. Community Access and Integration Program Community Access and Integration Program (CAIP) strives to connect clients to resources and support that meet their non-legal and social service needs through case management, whilst offering one-on-one wellness check-ins, goal setting, support groups, and more to help equip clients with the skills to continue enriching our Memphis community, experience genuine achievement, and most importantly, empower them to lead stable, flourishing lives.","Advocacy, Immigrant & Refugee, Justice & Legal Services",901-729-9560,advocates@airlegal.org,https://www.airlegal.org/,"3000 Walnut Grove Rd suite 302, Memphis, TN 38111, USA",Memphis,TN,Closed; Mon - Fri10:30 AM -  7:30 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

As the lead agency, Raphah coordinates the restorative justice program; however, Tennessee Voices for Victims has come alongside them, understanding the benefit to both the victim and responsible youth. Unlike a victim offender dialogue, the responsible youth has the opportunity to repair the harm directly to their victim. Unlike the traditional court system, the victim has the opportunity to directly tell the youth the impact their crime had on them. To learn more about this innovative program, please visit Raphah's Giving Matters site. Mass Violence Victim Response TVFV is working with entities across the state to develop the framework for improved response to victims of mass violence events. This improved response will include guidelines for including advocates on-site of the mass violence event as well as more complete follow through after the event. This project will include training advocates to respond at these scenes as well as working with the current first responders on how to best incorporate these service providers on-site.","Advocacy, Emergency & Safety, Inmate & Formerly Incarcerated",615-390-5202,info@tnvoicesforvictims.org,https://www.tnvoicesforvictims.org/,"270 Locustwood Drive, Nashville, TN 37211, USA",Nashville,TN,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success

Vision: PENCIL exists to create a world where MNPS students and teachers have equitable access to resources and opportunities, empowering students to succeed now and in the future. We will do this by creating a community that respects the unique perspectives and experiences of all stakeholders through proactive listening, continuous learning, and tireless advocacy for every student. Services: While PENCIL programs serve all Metro Nashville Public Schools (MNPS) students, they are of particular benefit to students who lack the financial means and schools that lack the community resources.

Harvest Hands CDC,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/658,"Mission: Harvest Hands is a catalyst for Christ-centered, holistic community development working alongside our neighbors to further healthy living, education, spiritual formation, and economic development in South Nashville. Services: After School Program The primary way Harvest Hands furthers education in our communities is through out-of-school (after school and summer) programming. Our elementary and middle school out-of-school programs provide a safe place for 100 students in grades pre-kindergarten through eighth grade to receive homework help, benefit from leadership development lessons and activities, receive mentoring and access to positive role models, and engage in arts, sports, and cultural activities. Concepts learned in school are reinforced through creative activities and games that are specifically designed for their grade level. Staff members, interns, and volunteers serve as mentors and create the stability, consistency, and structure that is lacking in many of our students’ lives. We aim to raise up a generation of leaders from our neighborhood to make way for transformation in South Nashville. Humphreys Street Social Enterprise Born out of a desire to create jobs in our neighborhood, provide mentoring opportunities, and train teenagers in job skills, Harvest Hands created Humphreys Street. This social enterprise annually employs 16 teens and generates $150,000 in revenue that is poured directly back into the community and the students we serve. When a local teen applies for and receives a job at Humphreys Street, they are given the opportunity to earn money in a neighborhood where few positive economic opportunities exist. Students employees tour colleges, learn about trade school options, receive career coaching, have access to ACT prep courses, spend time with mentors, participate in financial literacy classes, and are provided with resources to open checking and savings accounts. Upon graduating high school, students can receive academic scholarships. In July 2018, Humphreys Street opened its first brick and mortar coffee shop in Wedgewood-Houston. Healthy Living We believe a healthy community and healthy living go hand-in-hand. Due to transportation and financial barriers, many students in our communities are unable to participate in school-sanctioned sports. In order to meet this community need, we created Empower Sports—affordable, local sports leagues and wellness opportunities for youth. Similar to our model for out-of-school programming, we charge $10 per student per league in order to provide service with dignity. We currently offer flag football, basketball, soccer, and lacrosse leagues for students in pre-kindergarten through eighth grade.In addition to Empower Sports, we seek to incorporate healthy living principles in our out-of-school programming. After school and throughout the summer, students benefit from participating in yoga classes, urban gardening courses, cooking lessons, and health fairs that teach about nutrition, exercise, disease and illness prevention, and more.","Faith-Based, Youth Development",615-499-4963,info@harvesthandscdc.com,https://www.harvesthandscdc.com/,"155 Old Hermitage Avenue, Nashville, TN, USA",Nashville,TN,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success

Crossroads Campus,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/277,"Mission: We believe in the healing power of the human-animal bond. Our mission is to transform lives by creating opportunities for individuals facing poverty and homelessness to care for homeless dogs and cats. Services: Caring Connections is a humane education program that provides healing experiences for troubled youth through positive interactions with animals. Humane education enhances empathy, self-awareness, and self-esteem, all of which are critical to positive youth development and may play a role in reducing violence in our communities. For young people who have faced adversity, especially those who are dealing with the effects of neglect, abuse or trauma, humane education provides an opportunity to change not only the way these individuals view animals, but also the way they view themselves and other people. Caring Connections empowers young people by recognizing that they have something of value to give and can make a difference in the lives of vulnerable animals. Through lessons in animal companionship, dog training and animal safety, the students learn things like 'how to read a dog’s body language' and come to understand the effect that their own body language and tone of voice have on a dog. This enhanced self-awareness can transcend their interactions with animals and lead to improved relations with peers and adults. The students also learn the power of positive reinforcement, a critically important parenting tool, as they experience firsthand how much more effectively they can train a dog using treats and praise, than with threats or an angry voice. Of equal importance is the opportunity for these young people to laugh and experience joy as they work with the dogs-- using games such as hide-and-seek to teach name recognition or trying various antics to coax a dog through a tunnel during agility training. Lastly, Humane education teaches the proper treatment of animals, changing the way these young adults look at dogs, cats, and other animals in their communities. By empowering these young adults, we reduce the perpetuation of misconceptions that lead to animal abuse, neglect, and pet overpopulation, one positive interaction between person and pet at a time. Crossroads Pets- Shop & Adopt is a “pet retail” social enterprise, launched in 2013, to provide (1) job-training and employment for at risk young people, (2) shelter and adoptions for homeless pets through a public/private partnership with Metro Animal Care and Control, and (3) earned revenues to help sustain the program. This job-training/employment program provides work readiness, including the importance of punctuality, respectful communication with supervisors, customer service relations, and conflict resolution. It also provides job-skills training in the areas of pet retail, basic animal/kennel care, and grooming assistance. Through a partnership with Volunteer State Community College, we also offer a 10-week certification course in small animal care in order to provide tangible measures of success to both our interns and future employers. Based on Bureau of Labor statistics, faster than average job growth and a “bright outlook” for job opportunities are expected for animal care workers statewide. Our job-training Interns come to us through referrals from our community partners— which include Oasis, Monroe Harding, Goodwill, Martha O’Bryan, YouthCan and KIPP Academy— for internships lasting six to eight weeks. During these initial internships, stipends are provided by the referring agency. If at the end, an intern wishes to stay on and we are confident that they will benefit, we move them onto our payroll for extended job-training/employment. Through caring for our adoptable pets, assisting our groomers and working in our retail store, these young people acquire work readiness and hard job-skills, and enhanced confidence and empathy within a nurturing environment. The Crossroads Campus Affordable Housing Program for young adults opened in 2016 as a pilot, model program above our social enterprise pet store in Germantown. It consists of a 4-bedroom unit, with shared kitchen and living accommodations.","Animals, Housing & Homelessness, Human & Social Services",(615) 712-9758,info@crossroadscampus.org,http://crossroadscampus.org/,"707 Monroe St, Nashville, TN 37208, USA",Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon - Fri12:00 PM -  8:00 PM (EDT); Sat12:00 PM -  7:00 PM  (EDT); Sun12:00 PM -  7:00 PM  (EDT),,success

Choosing Justice Initiative,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/407,"Mission: Representing defendants in their court cases at no cost to the defendants. Vision: CJI’s vision is for a criminal legal system in Nashville where everyone experiences justice. What is justice? ​ What justice means to each of us is influenced and shaped by our culture, our education, our family history, our spiritual beliefs, and our own life experiences. For some, it is punishment and retribution; for others, it is forgiveness and healing. Because of our differences, what looks and feels like justice to one person may very well look and feel like injustice to someone else. ​ CJI was founded in late 2018 by former Nashville Public Defender Dawn Deaner, whose perspective on justice was heavily influenced by her 21 years advocating on behalf of poor people in Nashville’s criminal legal system. After learning about restorative justice, and reflecting upon how routinely she witnessed injustice in the courtroom and beyond, Dawn was ready to work for justice in a new way – one that empowered people suffering injustice to pursue justice as they defined it. ​ At CJI, we believe justice exists when every person has equal freedom under the law to exercise the power of choice and self-determination in relationship with others, and when peace is maintained by a shared respect for the dignity of every person – regardless of their circumstances – and treating every person equitably. Services: We provide free high-quality criminal defense and related legal services to indigent and underprivileged persons accused or convicted of crimes in Tennessee who request our representation, and promote the elimination of wealth-based disparities and injustice in Tennessees criminal legal system.",Justice & Legal Services,(615) 431-3746,info@cjinashville.org,https://www.cjinashville.org/,"1623 Haynes Meade Circle, Nashville, TN 37207, USA",Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon - Fri11:00 AM -  7:00 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success
Communities In Schools of Tennessee,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/415,"Mission: Communities In Schools (CIS) of Tennessee surrounds students with a community of support, empowering them to stay in school and achieve in life. Services: Integrated Student Supports in Tennessee Public Schools CIS of Tennessee places a highly qualified caring adult, known as a ""site coordinator"", directly inside each partner school. Their job is to connect students and their families to critical community resources tailored to their specific needs. Students struggling with low-incomes or poverty face daily barriers to school success. These barriers may include - food insecurity, lack of transportation, unsafe housing, and unmet mental health and medical needs. CIS of Tennessee provides three tiers of services. Tier one services are available to the whole school. These services help foster a positive school climate and address school-level risk factors. Tier two are targeted programs typically provided in a group setting to students with a common need. Tier three is our case management services provided in a one-to-one setting to students with highly specific needs. Academic Assistance Our site coordinators work hard to ensure that students have the resources they need to progress academically. From providing students with virtual learning support, credit recovery assistance, to finding tutors and creating quiet spaces where students can study, we do whatever it takes to create an optimal learning environment for our students. Basic Needs What can seem like small obstacles can easily lead students off track. That’s why ensuring students have access to basic needs is so important. A student cannot focus in the classroom if they are hungry, cold or tired, or cannot see the board. Our site coordinators Most important, we ensure that home is a healthy nurturing environment where students always feel safe. College & Career Readiness Both higher education and the modern workplace are evolving rapidly, and with this shift come new opportunities, greater competition, more complex skill sets, and job titles that didn’t exist a few years ago. It’s a lot to process, especially for students already dealing with their own unique challenges. For students pursuing college, we help decipher the application process, explore scholarship opportunities, tour campuses and conduct mock interviews. For those planning to enter the work force, we help students discover enjoyable, sustainable career paths and connect them to internships and job shadowing opportunities. For those undecided, our site coordinators provide a safe sounding board to articulate goals and fears, and explore options. Many of our kids have a limited frame of reference of what their careers can be, so an important part of our job is making them aware of the possibilities and encouraging them to “dream big”. From there, we help them understand and meet the requirements to ultimately achieve their goals. Family Engagement We know that greater parental involvement in a student’s life promotes greater student success. But parents and guardians often face their own obstacles. Language barriers, busy work schedules, and other family obligations can keep caregivers from getting involved in their child’s student life. CIS sees family engagement as a crucial element to our success, and work to remove barriers that prevent caregivers from staying central in their child’s education. CIS helps support a healthy school environment where students and families feel safe and welcome. Our site coordinators are advocates for all families and check in with families often to keep them updated on their students' progress. They’ve worked with teachers to offer community-based parent teacher nights so more parents could attend and have sponsored family nights and parent support groups to help parents stay involved. Life/Social Skills Life/social skills cover a broad range of topics – including personal health and hygiene, money management, digital footprint best practices, character development, and other essential skills such as how to study, how to manage time, and even how to set and achieve goals. Site coordinators teach students how to work together with others, interact with authority figures and manage anger and other emotions. Mastering life skills helps students engage more effectively with others, resolve issues diplomatically and understand the importance of compromise, patience, and other social values.","Children & Family Services, Education, Youth Development",(615) 727-1341,info@cistn.org,https://www.cistn.org/,"1207 18th Ave S, Nashville, TN 37212, USA",Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon - Fri10:00 AM -  6:30 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

GLSEN Inc,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/719,"Mission: GLSEN Tennessee is a chapter of GLSEN, a national organization fighting for every student’s right to a safe, supportive education. GLSEN Tennessee is a grassroots initiative, working locally in our community to ensure safe schools for all students, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity. There are 43 Chapters around the country doing this important work. Join us today! Our chapter supports students and educators locally, organizes around LGBTQ-affirming public policy, plans teacher trainings, and hosts events for students, educators, parents, and allies. Chapters like ours play an important role in bringing GLSEN’s programs and visions to right where we live, work, and learn. While some chapters have full-time or part-time staff, most are entirely volunteer-based. We're always looking for new volunteers to help us ensure safe schools for all students. Explore our website to find out more about our work here in Tennessee and to learn about how you can get involved in local and national events. Vision: At GLSEN, we want every student, in every school, to be valued and treated with respect, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. We believe that all students deserve a safe and inclusive school environment where they can learn and grow. Services: We accomplish our goals by working in hallways across the country -- from Congress and the Department of Education to schools and district offices in your community -- to improve school climate and champion LGBT issues in K-12 education. Every day GLSEN works to ensure that LGBTQ students are able to learn and grow in a school environment free from bullying and harassment. Together, we can transform our nation’s K-12 schools into the safe and affirming environment all youth deserve. Day of Silence GLSEN’s Day of Silence is a student-led national event where folks take a vow of silence to highlight the silencing and erasure of LGBTQ people at school. GLSEN's Day of Silence is one element of a larger effort to create safe and inclusive schools for all students, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. Ally Week GLSEN's Ally Week is a student-powered program where LGBTQ K-12 students and LGBTQ educators lead the conversation on what they need from their allies in school. No Name-Calling Week GLSEN’s No Name-Calling Week is a week organized by K-12 educators and students to end name-calling and bullying in schools. Safe Space Kit Bullying and harassment are the norm for far too many LGBTQ youth. But the presence of a supportive educator is proven to make a difference. GLSEN’s Safe Space Kit comes with resources to help educators create safe, more inclusive learning environments for LGBTQ students. With a Safe Space Kit schools have access to our 42-page guide filled with concrete strategies, and an informative poster and stickers that help students identify supportive educators in their school. Student Leadership Spearheading our efforts to encourage youth leadership internally and across the country, each year, GLSEN selects outstanding LGBGTQ students from across the country to form our National Student Council. This GLSEN-sponsored youth leadership and engagement program supports student members as they dedicate their time, passion, and commitment to our mission for safer schools while also elevating the voices of marginalized groups within the LGBTQ community, including youth of color, rural, transgender, and gender nonconforming youth. National Student Council members advise GLSEN programming and campaigns, offer valuable insight to GLSEN’s staff and Board of Directors, and share their stories in popular media and policymakers. They are the experts regarding their experiences and their insights bring depth and breadth to GLSEN’s student work. In addition to this, GLSEN is on a misson to register 10,000 GSAs during the 2018-2019 school year. We know, from our National Scool Climate Survey (first-of-its-kind research) that students involved in GSAs are more than twice as likely to describe their classmates as accepting (54.7 vs 28.3), less likely to feel unsafe at school (51.7 vs 67.3), and are less likely to miss school because of safety concerns (28.7 vs 41.8).

Urban Green Lab,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/126,"Mission: At Urban Green Lab, we teach communities how to live sustainable lives. Founded in 2009, we work to ensure all of us have access to sustainable living education, with an emphasis on preventing waste. Through a focus on classrooms, households, and workplaces -- places where culture begins -- Urban Green Lab transforms spaces into “labs” for rethinking what it means to live sustainably by training and certifying professionals, organizing and facilitating exchange of best practices, connecting institutions with services, and encouraging people to feel good about being part of the solution. Services: Sustainable Classrooms: The Sustainable Classrooms division aims to show that sustainable living can be a part of any classroom. Using our standards-aligned curriculum, a PBL project, and student-led home investigations as a base, we explore how to use a sustainability lens in any formal or informal K-12 classroom. Our professional development training provides educators with the confidence, tools, and community needed to empower students to make lifelong sustainable choices. Nashville Environmental Justice Initiative: The Nashville Environmental Justice Initiative (NEJI) works to educate community stakeholders on the tenants of environmental justice and collaborative problem solving that protects and empowers Nashville’s most marginalized communities from environmental hazards. Through a partnership between Urban Green Lab and Tennessee State University, the initiative is designed to grow a culture of systemic learning around environmental justice in the city by exploring the issues facing marginalized communities today, developing impactful educational solutions, and connecting thought leaders to better mobilize their collective impact so Nashville grows responsibly for its people, profit, and the planet. Urban Green Lab Certification: Urban Green Lab officially recognizes community institutions – like schools, businesses, and nonprofits -- as Nashville-approved “Urban Green Labs.” A lab is any workplace that proves its commitment to the practice and training of sustainable behaviors and explores new ways for making decisions that better protect our people, profit, and planet. We use an annual assessment to diagnose your needs, then work together to kickstart your green team, create a strategic plan, connect you with fellow workplaces and experts, and help better tell your story. Nashville Food Waste Initiative: Founded by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) in 2015 and in partnership with the Environmental Law Institute, the Nashville Food Waste Initiative (NFWI) drives citywide policies and strategies that reduce food waste by preventing wasted food, rescuing surplus food for those in need, and composting and recycling food scraps to build healthy soil. Through the NFWI, Urban Green Lab organizes, trains, and connects diverse food waste stakeholders year-round and offers training for how you can reduce food waste in your own institution. Nashville Sustainability Roundtable: The Nashville Sustainability Roundtable brings together professionals (including young professionals) from all corners of the city year-round to learn, exchange best practices, and act collectively on sustainability issues. Free and open to anyone, the Roundtable’s topics are based on Nashville’s own sustainability story, but grounded in the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Roundtable includes expert panels, networking with local vendors, workshop-style interaction, and the chance to join industry-specific committees. Students in Sustainability: Students in Sustainability matches Nashville high school juniors and seniors with local business green teams (including nonprofits) to learn how workplaces strive to become more sustainable. Each academic year, small cohorts of students work alongside green team professionals (now virtually due to COVID-19) to help them research and solve actual sustainability challenges, then formally present their solutions at semester’s end. It’s a great way to learn, network, build mentorships and professional skills, and discover how any job can be a green job.

Starting in January of the next year, the employer starts deducting that amount from the employee's paycheck, and forwards the contribution to Community Shares and we in turn, pay it out to our member groups. Our goal is for every employee of a workplace to learn about our member groups and the great work they are doing to make lasting change a issues such as violence, environmental degradation, disability rights, women's rights, LGBTQ rights, animal welfare, and social justice.

We work to show these workplaces why choice in giving is important and why Community Shares is a good fit for their employees. Volunteer and Leadership Development Volunteers are especially utilized in the workplace campaigns, passing out fundraising materials, and collecting pledges, encouraging co-workers to give to Community Shares. However we also need volunteers to help us contact businesses about adding Community Shares to their employee giving campaign to help us work with their own employer to add Community Shares to their employee giving campaign to help with trainings for member groups on social media, setting measurable and strategic goals, etc.to help with event fundraising Membership Development Our vision is to be a source of support for the widest range of social change groups across the state.

Medicare and over 90% of third party health insurance plans don't pay for hearing aids.

Brooklyn Heights Community Garden,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/293,"Mission: BHCG is a non-profit, USDA-certified urban farm located on formerly vacant lots in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood in Nashville, TN. Our .56 acre farm & community hub serves our historically Black and low-income neighborhood that experiences food apartheid. Vision: The founder of Brooklyn Heights Community Garden (BHCG) Nella ""Ms. Pearl"" Frierson had the vision for Brooklyn Heights Community Garden over a decade ago. In 2009, she bought 1833 & 1835 Haynes St, which at the time were vacant lots across the street from her home. She started growing a garden on the land and inviting people to join her. In 2014, she registered BHCG as a 501c3. In 2019, she bought the house next to the garden to use as a work-housing space for garden workers, interns, and artists. BHCG is registered with the USDA Farm Service Agency as an urban farm. ​ The creation of this garden stemmed from a deep need for the community to get back to its roots of connection between our elders and our young people, to rebuild and reconstruct self­-awareness, self-pride, and self-esteem, and to remind people of all ages how to play in the dirt. Many of the residents in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood are elderly and on fixed incomes. There are no grocery stores within a mile from the garden. Public transportation is inadequate for residents who don't have another form of mobility. This is why our work is vital. We provide much needed fresh, healthy fruits, vegetables, and herbs right here in our own neighborhood.","Community & Economic Development, Environment, Hunger & Food Security",615-474-2887,brooklynhcgarden@gmail.com,https://www.brooklynheightscommunitygarden.org/,"1830 Haynes St, Nashville, TN 37207, USA",Nashville,TN,Always Open,,success

Sweetgrass Inc.,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/676,"Mission: The mission of Sweetgrass is to develop and sustain supportive intergenerational neighborhoods that promote community and caring for people with mild disabilities, social cohesion for families, children and singles, and safety and purpose in the lives of older adults, in the tradition of communities from the past. Vision: To create the first farm-to-table community near Nashville, TN that is focused on serving active seniors, young families, and those with mild disabilities. Services: Program for people with mild disabilities Sweetgrass provides housing and independent living services for high functioning learning disabled young to middle age adults, who do not need the structure of a group home, but need a support system, guidance and supervision to live on their own. Goals of this program also include social opportunities, as well as job training and job coaching, and training for life when parents are no longer available to help. Seniors and other residents in the community act as mentors and advisors. A staff member functionsas case manager. The program will meet the needs of people who often are not eligible for Medicaid Waivers, or Choices programs and their disabilities are considered borderline. This group makes up approximately 20% of the residents at Sweetgrass. Program for Active Seniors Sweetgrass provides affordable housing and support services for seniors, who make up approximately 40% of the residentpopulation in the community. Seniors are able to live in an intergenerational environment with people of all ages, and continue lives of involvement and purpose through their mentoring and volunteer work with people with learning differences as wellas with young families with children. Program for young families and singles Sweetgrass provides housing and services for young families and singles. They will make up 40% of the resident population. Young families can be socially isolated and in need of a support system. Seniors in the community will act as adoptive grandparents and will be available to babysit and tutor and lend a listening ear. Other young parents and singles will support each other as well. Singles don't want to age alone and can enjoy being part of a ""family"" at Sweetgrass. Community meals help young parents with the responsibility of providing meals for their families. Nature/Agriculture The Sweetgrass community is designed to be anchored by a small farm, with an organic vegetable garden and other farm production. The garden supplies food grown on site, which improves the health and well-being of residents. In addition, the garden will provide work for residents, whether they are people with mild disabilities, children, young adults or seniors. Growing vegetables, herbs and flowers has been shown to be therapeutic activity and gives many people pleasure. Living in an environment close to nature reduces stress levels, as does living in an environment with reduced traffic noise. A goal of the community is to teach stewardship of the land. Permaculture principles will be used, which emphasize building healthy soils in order to produce nutritious vegetables and grass for grazing. By strategically pairing plants, resilience is increased and as the soil becomes deeper and more rich, the health of plants improves and chemicals and artificial fertilizers are not needed.","Community & Economic Development, Housing & Homelessness, Seniors",(615) 481-5780,,http://www.sweetgrassvillage.org/,"4400 Belmont Park Terrace unit 124, Nashville, TN 37215, USA",Nashville,TN,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success

Beacon Center of Tennessee,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/470,"Mission: The Beacon Center empowers Tennesseans to reclaim and protect their freedoms, so that they can freely pursue their version of the American Dream. Services: Innovation Freedom and Emerging Technologies Beacon is working to ensure that Tennessee remains a place where entrepreneurs and small business owners can start their businesses without fear of the government getting in their way. Or that new products and services aren’t shut down by competition looking to win through lobbying politicians rather than proving their value in the marketplace. Tennessee should create an environment that allows new businesses and innovators to develop and bring their businesses to the market, creating jobs and improving the lives of all. To do so, the state should follow the lead of other states and countries by creating a regulatory sandbox, where entrepreneurs can ensure their new product or service won’t be subject to archaic and onerous regulations that don’t apply well to new technologies. Additionally, Tennessee leaders should look to study and work with industry leaders to ensure Tennessee’s business landscape is ready for new technologies, whether that is drones, autonomous vehicles, or other innovations. Why can’t Tennessee lead the nation in innovation freedom or be the next Silicon Valley? Or perhaps more importantly, what will our lives look like if we don’t? Protecting Worker Freedom Beacon believes that Right to Work is so fundamental to our economic success that it deserves constitutional protections. Right to Work should be recognized as a fundamental right, not just the longstanding policy of our state. Expanding Access to Quality Healthcare With ever the increasing costs of healthcare, Tennesseans are looking for innovative solutions to increase access, improve outcomes and lower costs. While much focus on healthcare is at the federal level, there are many things that can be done right here in our home state. Beacon continues to work with state lawmakers to be incubators of freer market healthcare options for Tennesseans that expand quality and access to patients across the socio-economic spectrum. One example was when, lawmakers repealed more than half of the state’s certificate-of-need laws. These antiquated regulations, which ban providers from investing in services and locations without their competitor’s approval, range from restraints on the number of hospital beds to the number of MRI machines available to patients. Beacon also continues to fight for new alternative delivery models for healthcare, like when the Tennessee General Assembly overwhelmingly passed direct primary care, allowing patients with unaffordable deductibles or those who are uninsured to contract directly with their primary care for an average cost of $30-$50 per month. In doing so, patients across the Volunteer State will now have greater access to essential services and care, while costs decrease as the ceiling expands to new competition in the healthcare marketplace. Expanding Educational Freedom Access to a quality education is the greatest equalizer in society. Every child deserves access to a quality education that best fits their unique educational needs. However, when we continue to rely on a ZIP code to determine a child’s access to education, we trap low- and middle-income families in a system with no options. If a child is zoned for a school that can’t meet their unique needs, that family’s only option is to take the financial responsibility upon themselves find an alternative for that student—a cost barrier that prevents the majority of families across the state from being able to send their child to the school that best suits their needs and prepares them for a bright future. The Beacon Center believes the state should fund children, not systems. Tennessee began to change that paradigm in 2015 when by passing the Individualized Education Account program (IEAs) for students with special needs—making the Volunteer State just the fourth in the nation to pass these savings accounts (otherwise known as Education Savings Accounts or “ESAs”), considered to be the most state-of-the-art and modernized approach to education reform out there today. We followed that victory with another win for Tennessee families by passing the Course Access Program in 2016—a program that gives public high school students statewide access to course curriculum not offered at their individual school.",Advocacy,615-383-6431,Jamie@beacontn.org,https://www.beacontn.org/,"1200 Clinton Street #205, Nashville, TN 37203, USA",Nashville,TN,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success

Founded in 1974, the Mid-Cumberland Human Resource Agency is an independent, non-profit organization committed to helping individuals and communities become more self-sufficient. Mid-Cumberland provides services that work toward improving the health, well-being, and economic opportunities of people needing critical support or of those who may have an immediate need. Vision: Mid-Cumberland makes a positive difference in the lives of Tennesseans by working in partnership with them to foster independent living and, in the process, restore hope and dignity to their lives. Headquartered in Nashville, Mid-Cumberland spans Middle Tennessee with offices in 13 counties. Services: SERVING 13 COUNTIES Our service area includes Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Houston, Humphreys, Montgomery, Robertson, Rutherford, Stewart, Sumner, Trousdale, Williamson, and Wilson counties, with our central office in Nashville (Davidson County). Meals-on-Wheels: A hot meal and a good friend are two of life’s greatest enjoyments. Meals-on-Wheels has been providing both for more than 40 years. In fact, we provide congregate meals, home-delivered meals, outreach, nutrition education, supportive services, and recreational activities for individuals age 60 and older. Hot meals are planned by a registered dietician and prepared in a commercial kitchen Monday–Friday and delivered to the meal sites; volunteers deliver the meals and take great care to place food in proper storage. Each meal site must pass the Health Department’s rigorous cleanliness and safety inspections. Research shows that seniors who have pets also have fewer physician appointments—21 percent fewer visits than those who do not own a pet. So in response, we have also partnered with various vendors to offer pet food delivery. Public Transit: WITH FARES OFTEN LOWER THAN THE COST OF A GALLON OF GAS! Mid-Cumberland Public Transit is a curb-to-curb rural transportation system with flexible schedules to meet the needs of its passengers. Rides are scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis, with priority given to medical appointments. While we request advance notice, it is not required. Please be assured your personal information will remain confidential. We are a general public provider, equal-opportunity employer, and serve all 12 Middle Tennessee counties. As a non-profit, tax-exempt organization, all donations are tax-deductible. Mid-Cumberland Homemaker: Mid-Cumberland's Homemaker service provides essential services to some of the Mid-Cumberland region’s most vulnerable residents: its seniors, disabled, and individuals at risk of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. The Homemaker service provides essential in-home services to elderly and disabled individuals enabling them to retain their independence; free of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. Many elderly residents in the Mid-Cumberland region live alone and are in danger of being neglected, exploited, or abused. With the broad range of services offered we are able to address most of the services needed to allow the client to remain SAFELY independent in their own home. Homemakers perform the essential tasks which the client is no longer able to do for him or herself. Most commonly staff assist clients with budgeting, bill paying, access to medical care, community resources, legal assistance, general household tasks, and essential transportation as well as performing additional essential tasks which the client is no longer able to do for him or herself. Homemakers also assist in investigations and provide monitoring to ensure clients experience elimination of or reduction in abuse, neglect, or exploitation. The Homemaker is often the only advocate our vulnerable clients have. Without Homemaker services many residents would be forced into institutional care prematurely or worse; remain victims of abuse, neglect, or exploitation by those that were supposed to protect them.

Mid-South Immigration Advocates Inc.,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/561,"Mission: Our mission is to provide quality, free and low-cost immigration representation to low-income Mid-Southerners, to seek justice for the entire immigrant community, and to advocate for fair immigration policies. Services: The Children's Project MIA’s Children’s Project provides free direct legal representation to children facing deportation. Children’s Project clients have recently fled to the United States to reunite with family in the Mid-South from Central America to escape violence and extreme poverty. MIA defends these children against deportation while helping them obtain lawful permanent residency in the United States. The Children’s Project protects children from harm while keeping families together. In April 2019, MIA began providing legal services to unaccompanied minors placed in transitional foster care homes in Nashville, TN. These children are particularly vulnerable minors for whom placement in a children's shelter would be inappropriate while awaiting reunification with family or friends living in the U.S. The Survivors' Project MIA provides free legal services to a significant number of victims of violent crime, particularly domestic violence and sexual assault. These clients include asylum seekers fleeing persecution in their home countries and immigrants who have been targeted for violent crime here in our communities. U.S. law provides pathways to lawful status for immigrants who have been victims of certain violent crimes in the U.S., such as domestic violence, rape, felony assault, and human trafficking. MIA accepts referrals for Memphis-area victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, stalking, and similar crimes. Family Unity Project Clients seeking to obtain lawful status via a family member pay an income-based, sliding-scale legal fee through our Family Unity Project. Family Unity Project fees are approximately 85 – 95 percent lower than those of a private attorney. All Family Unity clients live in households below 150 percent of federal poverty level. People benefiting from this program include immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. Many people in our community qualify for legal status, but simply cannot afford expensive legal fees. Ensuring that “mixed status” families stay together provides economic and social benefits to our entire community. Asylum Initiative Through the Asylum Initiative, MIA currently represents recent Afghan arrivals. Our organization collaborates with Welcome South Coalition in this effort. MIA is seeking resources to provide more comprehensive support to detained asylum seekers in the Mid-South.","Immigrant & Refugee, Justice & Legal Services",(901) 244-4367,info@miamemphis.org,https://miamemphis.org/,"1101 Kermit Drive, Nashville, TN, USA",Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon - Fri11:00 AM -  7:00 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

"Operation Homefront, Inc",https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/680,"Mission: Operation Homefront builds strong, stable and secure military families so they can thrive, not simply struggle to get by, in the communities they work so hard to protect. Services: We help military families through a variety of financial challenges by providing impactful programs designed to ensure that short-term needs do not turn into long-term struggles that derail any hope for a brighter future. Our programs focus on: RELIEF through critical financial assistance and transitional and permanent housing programs; RECURRING FAMILY SUPPORT during financially stressful periods throughout the year. Relief Programs Operation Homefront provides various forms of relief to military families through its programs, such as Critical Financial Assistance, as well as veteran housing assistance programs including Transitional Housing (Villages), Transitional Homes for Veterans, Transitional Housing (Apartments), and Permanent Housing. This ensures that short-term issues do not turn into long-term crises for families. CRITICAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Operation Homefront recognizes that service members and their families should not have to face urgent financial crises alone. That’s why we offer our Critical Financial Assistance program, providing emergency financial assistance for veterans and their families. Our program addresses critical financial shortfalls, including mortgage payments, rent, utilities, car repairs, home repairs, overdue bills, critical baby items, and groceries. Our professional caseworkers manage the process and validate the financial needs of the family before providing support. We offer assistance in the form of grants, not loans, and pay directly to service providers or provide a grocery card to families. TRANSITIONAL HOMES FOR VETERANS Operation Homefront’s veteran housing assistance programs recognize that the transition to civilian life can be challenging for many veterans and their families, especially when it comes to homeownership. Some families may not have the funds for a down payment or are unable to sustain homeownership. To address this issue, in 2018, Operation Homefront launched the Transitional Homes for Veterans program. The program offers eligible families the chance to live in a rent-free, single-family home for a period of two to three years, while also receiving financial counseling and community support. TRANSITIONAL HOUSING (VILLAGES) Transitional Housing (Villages), one of Operation Homefront’s veteran housing assistance programs, serves as a bridge for families during the lengthy period between the end of military pay and the beginning of veteran benefits or during the review and receipt of veterans’ disability claims. The program offers wounded, ill, and injured warriors and their families rent-free, two and three-bedroom apartments in San Diego, California; Gaithersburg, Maryland; and San Antonio, Texas. Our Villages not only provide a home for families during this challenging time but also alleviate financial stress and offer a comprehensive package of individualized family support and financial planning services. PERMANENT HOMES FOR VETERANS Operation Homefront is committed to providing long-term stability to military families, and one way we do that is through our Permanent Homes for Veterans program. Permanent Homes for Veterans offers a comprehensive approach to homeownership for veterans and their families. The program provides mortgage-free homes and pairs families with dedicated caseworkers and financial counselors who offer guidance and support throughout the process. Our goal is to help families not only achieve homeownership but also thrive in their new homes. Since its inception in 2012, the PHV program has successfully served over 700 families. Of that number, 680 families have successfully completed the program and received the deed to their homes, free of any mortgage obligations. We are proud to be a part of their journey and are committed to continuing to support veterans and their families as they make the transition to civilian life. Recurring Family Support Programs At Operation Homefront, we believe that every member of a military family deserves our support. That’s why we go above and beyond to show our appreciation and celebrate their contributions. Our annual Military Child of the Year Awards gala is a highlight of the year, where we honor extraordinary military kids who have shown remarkable resilience and leadership in the face of adversity. But our support doesn’t stop there. We also host a variety of events throughout the year, including Homefront Celebrations, Star-Spangled Babies Showers, Back-to-School Brigades, Holiday Meals for Military, and Holiday Toy Drive events. These events provide an opportunity for military families to come together and create lasting memories, knowing that they have the support of our entire community behind them. We are honored to serve those who have served our country and will continue to do everything we can to support them.",Veteran & Military,615-636-9864,info@operationhomefront.org,http://www.operationhomefront.org,"PO Box 158010 Nashville, TN 37215",PO Box 158010 Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon - Fri11:00 AM -  7:00 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

The adults learn skills that will help enhance their lives and give them the skills to achieve their highest level of independence. Health and Wellness BrightStone adults are provided the opportunity to participate in physical exercise both at our facility and in the community. A physical therapist (PT) provides an initial evaluation which determines their area of strength, weakness, and tolerance level. That information is the basis for individual exercise plans for each adult. A PT assistant or a physical trainer works with each adult in small groups to implement the exercise plan developed by the PT. The students go to the YMCA two times each week while the PT assistant has classes at BrightStone two or three times weekly. The adults also participate in therapeutic yoga twice each week and Special Olympics every year. A full time nurse is on staff to assist with any health or medical need as well as medication administration. The wellness program consists of classes in nutrition, dental hygiene, general physical care, etc; a walking program called ""BrightStriders""; and weekly food selection for their own menu. Therapeutic Program BrightStone has an emphasis on providing a variety of therapies which assist each adult to reach their highest potential. Some of the therapies provided in addition to physical therapy are music therapy, pet therapy, art therapy, along with individual opportunity for waiver funded language therapy and occupational therapy. BrightStone is a fieldwork site for doctoral Occupational Therapy students from Belmont University, thus bringing new insight and opportunities for our students and learning for our teaching staff.

Services: P2SI LEADERSHIP ACADEMY For over a decade, the Transformation Life Center has been intently involved in helping to provide financial resources, learning resources, and firsthand mentorship to collegiate students across the Middle Tennessee area. We noticed early on that our students were getting vast knowledge surrounding theory of their education. However, the most challenging aspect of their matriculation surrounded being able to connect their learning with application in real world terms. In fact, many of those students understood the purpose of an education, but could not grasp how they fit in the big picture. Essentially, they could not grasp their Purpose in it all. Seeing this, TLC went to work in developing clinics, programs, and live coaching and mentoring opportunities to help its scholarship students gain this important connectivity between their studies and their success. When our ""Successors"" graduate from P2S Leadership Academy, we know that vision of purpose is IGNITED within them. This opens a world of possibilities to them in education and beyond! BLACK MEN RUN, BROWN BOYS READ In partnership with schools and organizations in under-resourced communities, our volunteer partners share valuable time with our boys reading one-on-on or in small groups and providing reading support which builds the confidence they need to embrace and love reading. Each Brown Boys Read session is launched with a 10 minute speaker who introduces a key word and influential African American/Black role model. We introduce, model, and reinforce leadership skills, strategies and tools our boys will need to be leaders in their home, schools and community. In 2020, 35% of Metro Nashville Public School (MNPS) elementary students were either overweight or obese. We coach the boys each week and teach lessons that promote good health and habits. The season culminates with each boy running 3.1 miles in the Steps of Success 5K run/walk in September of each year. STEPS OF SUCCESS 5K FUNDRAISER The Steps of Success 5K is the most anticipated event of the year and serves as the first point of exposure for collegiate students into our success community.

Vision: To unify neighborhood stakeholders. To create beautiful, functional spaces. To build a better Green Hills for all. Services: Transportation Fund Improving transportation is the number one issue facing the Green Hills neighborhood. The Transportation Summit was our focus on transportation for early 2017. It was a presentation to the community which combined studies and simulations to show traffic improvements to Green Hills. The business district of Green Hills has become a bottleneck for traffic for the region; it creates traffic problems for commuters and residents, alike. Many of the solutions are costly, such as the realignment of key intersections, and it is difficult for the community to support one solution or another without first understanding the data. The proposed Transportation Summit collected, analyzed and presented data on key traffic improvements. The transportation fund would be used to follow-up on continued community education and transportation-related programs, such as the Jolly Trolley route - a compact trolley route in Green Hills over the holidays. We also hosted a transit debate which compiled community answers to our survey on transit, and we received over 400 responses to help shape the debate. The transportation fund might also be used to apply for grants to implement improvements in the Area Transportation Plan (adopted into NashvilleNext, the community plan for the next 25 years). Streetscape Improvements The Streetscape Improvements project encompasses the efforts to make pedestrian connectivity a more realistic option in the business district. If the pedestrian walkways are not pleasant, accessible and easy-to-find, people will simply take their car instead of walking. The first level of Streetscape Improvements include: wayfinding signs, trees, landscaping, benches, lighting and access to green space. The first phase of the wayfinding program would provide pedestrian-level maps on attractive, identity-creating kiosks; the budget for this first phase is $15,000 (the design fee is $5.6K of this amount). Educational Programming The Educational Programming is focused on community planning in Green Hills and Nashville. By keeping the community informed with quarterly meetings (formerly monthly) and newsletters, the stakeholders come to the table with a common understanding of how we might implement key projects within our current community plans. For 2019-2020, we have moved into an e-meeting format for a mayoral candidate questionnaire, which gathers questions from the community and solicits responses from the candidates, in order to inform the community on the candidates' views.

World Central Kitchen,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/193,"Mission: Founded in 2010 by Chef José Andrés, World Central Kitchen (WCK) is first to the frontlines, providing meals in response to humanitarian, climate, and community crises while working to build resilient food systems with locally led solutions. WCK has served more than 200 million fresh meals to people impacted by natural disasters and other crises around the world. WCK’s Resilience Programs strengthen food and nutrition security by training chefs and school cooks; advancing clean cooking practices; and awarding grants to farms, fisheries, and small food businesses while also providing educational and networking opportunities. Services: Our culinary school provides chef-designed culinary training to 40 students in Port-Au-Prince, Haiti each year. 100% of our graduates are placed into internships following the completion of the program and 70% are offered jobs following the completion of their internship. More than 4 million people die from health issues caused by unclean cookstoves each year. Our Clean Cooking programs seek to demonstrate long-term positive impacts on the health and livelihoods of impoverished communities in the Caribbean and Central America who still cook primarily with wood or charcoal. WCK builds and renovates school and community kitchens and converts them from cooking with wood or charcoal to clean burning liquid propane gas (LPG). We also install water lines and sinks so cooks can wash and clean more easily. We have transformed more than 140 kitchens in Haiti, making schools a cleaner and safer place to work and lear. Many school cooks around the world have never had reliable access to water for cleaning and are not familiar with basic kitchen safety and food handling practices. Sink to Stove’s professional chef trainers work with school and community cooks to train them in basic sanitary kitchen and food handling practices so as to help reduce the incidence of food borne illnesses. We conduct Sink to Stove trainings in all school kitchens that we build or update as part of our Clean Cooking program. We also partner with other organizations that oversee feeding programs in other schools to train their cooks in these important concepts. World Central Kitchen provides quality, chef-prepared meals to those in need. To date, we have served over 200 million meals to victims of natural disasters around the world. World Central Kitchen provides quality, chef-prepared meals to those in need. To date, we have served over 200 million meals to victims of natural disasters around the world. The program partners with and supports smallholder farmers, fishers, and small food-related businesses that produce or distribute food at a local level by providing funding, training, and networking opportunities. We also connect our grantees with volunteers who form part of a growing agritourism movement that brings much needed economic development to rural communities. In post-disaster communities, our immediate goal is to help our partners revitalize their operations and begin to regrow their long-term capacity for food production, distribution, and sales. In the long term, we aim to contribute to system-wide improvements in food security and sustainability by building up the day to day capacity of local communities to produce their own food. In doing so, we will also increase their resilience against future disasters.","Disaster Relief & Preparedness, Hunger & Food Security",1 (202) 844-6330,hello@wck.org,http://wck.org,"200 Massachusetts Ave NW 7th floor, Washington, DC 20001, USA",DC 20001,MA,Closed; Mon - Fri11:00 AM -  7:00 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

Vision: At Youth About Business, we have over 25 years of experience in creating opportunities for high school students from all backgrounds to learn about the business world in a stimulating and interactive environment. Through our programs and business camps, many of our high school students visit the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, and learn to use one of the most respected business analytical tools in the world, the Bloomberg Terminal. Every year the top-performing YAB students visit Sony’s Corporate Headquarters on Madison Avenue in New York City where they make one of their final presentations to defend the simulated Merger & Acquisition Transaction they developed over the course of our summer business camps. While YAB is open to all students, we take care to facilitate a pipeline to success for high school students from underserved and diversity backgrounds. This helps many of our students escape the cycle of hopelessness that occurs far too often in communities across America. Once YAB students complete our programs, they become part of our alumni network, a diverse community of talent, and can transition seamlessly from student to corporate culture with a deep understanding of business and finance.

"Learning Matters, Inc.",https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/732,"Mission: Learning Matters is a non-profit organization established in 2006 with a mission to reduce barriers to learning and ensure educational equity for K-12 students with learning differences. We believe access to high-quality academic intervention should not be limited by a student's zipcode. Services: One-on-One Teaching All teaching sessions at Learning Matters are one-on-one. Much attention is given to the match between the student and the teacher. Teaching sessions are typically one hour in length. Each student has an individualized teaching plan that is developed to address the needs of the student. Teaching records are maintained, and parents receive information monthly. Our goal is to help each of our students to succeed in their area of weakness. Progress is measured in a variety of ways. Some of the programs that we use have progress monitoring built into them. For some of our students the progress is measured by increased performance in school, and for others independent progress monitoring tools are utilized. Assessment Learning Matters conducts psycho-educational and diagnostic assessments. Psycho-educational assessments are comprehensive evaluations of cognitive abilities, academic abilities, and literacy skills. Psycho-educational assessments can be used to diagnose learning disabilities. Diagnostic assessments contain a personalized battery of tests based on the student’s needs. Most often, they include tests of reading, spelling, comprehension, and written expression. Data collected in the assessment, background data provided by the parents, student, and teachers, and previous testing when available is analyzed by the team, and a report is written. A feedback meeting is held with the parents to discuss the student’s learning profile and to discuss recommendations. The student is present at this meeting when appropriate. Assessments are invaluable in determining the causes of a student’s struggles in school. Educational Advocacy Learning Matters is available to provide educational advocacy for all of the students that we serve. Often, advocacy is helpful to parents when they are faced with communicating their desires to school personnel in IEP and student support meetings. The child’s unique learning profile can be shared with the teachers and administrators, and recommendations to better serve the student can be made. Educational advocacy often follows the assessment process. During this past calenar year, Learning Matters participated in over 53 school meetings to clarify the learning issues and attain possible interventions and accommodations for students we served. Summer Reading Intervention Our summer reading program provides 15 at-risk students from low-income neighborhood schools with seven weeks of intensive reading intervention provided by qualified teachers and learning specialists. The selected students have a diagnosed reading challenge that we can specifically address in this type of intensive, one-on-one environment. Our program also provides these students with positive role models and peer-to-peer relationship building. At the end of the summer, students demonstrate significant reading growth and increased confidence in their abilities as learners.","Education, Youth Development",615-739-0546,info@learningmattersinc.org,http://www.learningmattersinc.org,"3511 Belmont Blvd, Nashville, TN, United States",Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon10:00 AM -  8:00 PM  (EDT); Tue10:00 AM -  8:00 PM  (EDT); Wed10:00 AM -  8:00 PM  (EDT); Thu10:00 AM -  8:00 PM  (EDT); FriClosed; SatClosed; SunClosed,,success
Southern Environmental Law Center,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/733,"Mission: We are the Southern Environmental Law Center — the largest nonprofit, nonpartisan environmental legal advocacy organization rooted in and focused on the South. Our mission is to protect the basic right to clean air, clean water, and a livable climate; to preserve our region’s natural treasures and rich biodiversity; and to provide a healthy environment for all. Rooted in the South with over 200 attorneys and professional staff, we use strong legal and policy work, strategic vision, and pragmatic problem solving in all three branches and at all levels of government. With our commitment to place, SELC is building on nearly 40 years of success in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, and driving results that resonate across the nation. Services: Clean Energy & Air If the South were a country, it would be the seventh-largest emitter of carbon in the world. Recognizing that the South is central to any solution to global warming, SELC seeks to prevent further construction of coal-fired power plants in the Southeast; to retire old, dirty, coal-burning plants; and to increase investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. Clean Water The water-rich South has iconic and treasured waterways throughout our region. SELC seeks to protect the South’s cleanest waters, to rescue the most polluted ones, and to make sure there remains enough water flowing in our rivers and streams to support a healthy and diverse array of aquatic life. Mountains & Forests The Southern Appalachian Mountains are the backbone of the South, ranging uninterrupted from Virginia to Alabama. We are fortunate to have five million of these acres in public trust as national forest—the largest concentration of public land east of the Rockies. SELC is a staunch defender of these treasures, advocating particularly for long-term protection of old growth forest remnants, wildlife habitat, headwater streams, and places enjoyed for backcountry recreation. Land & Community Throughout our rapidly growing region, poorly planned development and road projects threaten the scenic landscapes and the everyday quality of life that we take for granted in our southern communities. SELC is focused on stopping destructive highway projects; reforming asphalt-centered transportation policies and wasteful land-use practices; and advancing cleaner, more efficient transportation choices such as rail and transit. Coast & Wetlands The coast is one of the South’s defining natural features. Nowhere else in the world can you find such an assemblage of sandy beaches, barrier islands, marshes, maritime forests, and estuaries. SELC is using our powerful arsenal to fend off destructive activities related to growth pressures and lax enforcement—and to proactively shape a sustainable future for our precious coastline. Wildlife & Special Places “Nature lacks a voice with which to speak for itself. Recognizing this, Congress has charged under federal law that agencies listen to the interests of the environment.” SELC couldn’t agree more with this pivotal decision, handed down in our litigation to prevent a Navy landing field, which ultimately protected a pocosin lake landscape that harbors tundra swans, snow geese, coastal black bears, and endangered red wolves. SELC’s legal team continues to defend the wild areas that are home to the South’s impressive array of wildlife. Our efforts are needed now more than ever, in light of attempts to undermine the Endangered Species Act and remove protections for sensitive species and critical habitat.",Environment,(615) 921-9470,selc@selcva.org,https://www.southernenvironment.org/about-us/office/nashville-tn/,"1033 Demonbreun Street suite 205, Nashville, Tennessee 37203, USA",Nashville,TN,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success

Vision: The vision of Intersection is to expand and shift the perspectives of audiences and musicians of all ages, through the creation, cultivation and performance of contemporary music, a vital, thriving and inspiring form of art. Services: Contemporary Concert Series With our fifth season, CORE, we aim to showcase our values - presenting significant musical repertoire and composers of the 20th and 21st centuries, celebrating the creation of new work, and collaborating with partners to connect the relevance of this repertoire to our lives – expanding perspectives and experiences, reimagining what music is and channeling the power of sound to express our world.In September Intersection presented “Stravinsky to Marsalis” to celebrate the 100th anniversary of one of the most important classical works of the 20th century - Stravinsky’s “L’Histoire du Soldat.” Paired with Wynton Marsalis' “The Fiddler’s Tale,” this concert combined jazz, classical, dance and theatre in a family-friendly performance at the W.O. Smith Community Music School in September. February brought composer and jazz trumpeter Hannibal Lokumbe to Nashville for the local premiere of his “Crucifixion Resurrection: Nine Souls a-Traveling” for chorus, instrumental ensemble, narrators and soloists, while also bringing his string quartets “Fannie Lou Hamer” and “Star for Anne” to individuals living in incarceration.

While rooted in Western classical music, Contempo Kids explores other styles and musical expressions, notation and methods of creation, tools, and technology.Discussions with teachers, families, and leadership of Metro Nashville Public Schools music education programs have confirmed that composition often receives less attention than music performance. Contempo Kids addresses this gap and, with the development of additional levels for students of different ages, has strong potential for expansion and to become a valuable resource for teachers.

American Entertainment Works Inc.,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/746,"Mission: It is the mission of AEWorks to create authentic entertainment arts that enrich, enlighten, educate and inspire, and make them accessible to everyone regardless of locale or socioeconomic status. Services: The iShakespeare Collection The iShakespeare Collection (iSC) is very simply, audio recordings of Shakespeare's plays for students and fans to download. Most of us first encounter the works of William Shakespeare in a text book - the language is arcane and difficult to understand. When Shakespeare wrote these words however, they were intended to be spoken aloud by actors and experienced by an audience - not read from a book. We've become disconnected from the original idea. The iShakespeare Collection bridges that disconnect. Keeping the original language intact, but using modern inflection and tone iSC helps improve retention and understanding. Produced before a live audience, in a table read type setting - so no sets, or costumes - iSC uses professional actors in the lead/major roles, with student /volunteers in secondary roles. Our 2015-16 production schedule plans for the production of """"Hamlet"""" and by 2016-17 we hope to produce two plays a year until the entire catalog is complete. Each production which includes a week of rehearsals and two performances costs @ $38,000. AEWorks Theater of the Web Theater of the Web (TOTW) is a series featuring classic and original one act plays - distributed on a dedicated YouTube channel. One act plays have been around since the ancient Greeks and they were wildly popular in Vaudeville. Then in the 1950s they became what we know today as the sit-com. There are thousands of these literary gems - mostly forgotten over time - because their style and language seems out of touch to today's audience. The themes and messages are however, still surprisingly relevant. The mission of Theater of the Web is to re-introduce classic works - along with some original plays -- by adapting the style and language to fit contemporary expectations - still keeping as much of the original humor, theme and plot as possible. TOTW is flipping the paradigm. We're not staging a play and bringing the audience to the theater - we take the theater to the audience. And, our show never closes. An episode of TOTW costs @ $28,000. Blues Alley Blues Alley is an online story-series about the places, people and the tales behind America's earliest original contribution to the arts - blues music. Blues Alley is NOT A DOCUMENTARY! Our goal is to tell the stories - official and apocryphal. While we're not out to mislead - the falsehoods we hold often reveal a greater truth. As Ken Kesey, says, """"It's the truth even if it didn't happen."""" Blues Alley is on a storytelling quest to find the places, faces and tales that fostered blues music. Tutwiler MS, Memphis TN, Greenwood MS, are the American equivalent of Vienna, Liepsig and Mannheim and Handy, Ma Rainey, and Robert Johnson are the American corollaries to Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven. We're now over a century removed from the beginnings of the blues - all of the founders are gone. But his is our story - and it's time for a retelling. Blues Alley costs between $1,200 and $7,500 and episode depending on artist, music and photo licensing. The Road Less Traveled Today's interstate highways and cost effective air travel have made it efficient to reach most any destination. Where we eat in the same chain restaurants, and shop the same stores we have at home. Before the completion of interstate highways, before the 28 thousand daily flights, people traveled on a series of roads we now consider secondary - roads that pass through the communities, by the businesses, and sights, that make up America. Once upon a time - we looked out the window at the landscape; not at our iPads. The Road Less Traveled rediscovers the vanishing heartland via these wandering pathways. Because, travel is about more than destination - It's about the journey. AEWorks mission is to inspire travelers to rediscover the people, places, sights, sounds and tastes along the Road Less Traveled. """"I - took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.""""

To move into the future equipped to lead, we need to build a body of evidence. Our Annual and Standards of Care Surveys are now a requirement in 2020.

Member Representation on Policy Reform and Advocacy TCCN works to educate and inform state policymakers about the comprehensive primary health care, behavioral health care, oral health care, pharmaceutical, and referral to specialty care needs of the uninsured and underinsured across Tennessee and the charitable healthcare organizations providing those services. Examples of these efforts include the coordination and preparation for Day On The Hill. Day On The Hill gives member organizations the opportunity meet with state House and Senate Representatives on a one on one basis to discuss policy reform and bill representation. Also, TCCN provides up to date information to member organizations about advocacy efforts to increase access to healthcare, how they can get involved, and the current climate of Charitable Health Care in Tennessee. Workforce Development TCCN is a partner in""Strengthening the Workforce of Tennessee’s Charitable Clinics"" to improve the essential knowledge and skills of the staff, volunteers and leadership of Tennessee’s charitable clinics, thereby strengthening clinic operations and sustainability, enhancing quality of care, improving healthcare access for vulnerable populations, and reducing health disparities.

Membership with TCCN scales based on the member's annual budget and is very affordable based on that criteria. Membership fees can be waived in cases of financial inability to contribute. More meaningful than membership dues, is TCCN's ability to reach and serve those who are reaching and serving low-income, uninsured, under-insured and under-served people living in Tennessee.","Advocacy, Health",(615) 970-6499,info@tccnetwork.org,https://www.tccnetwork.org/,"1515B Hayden Drive, Nashville, TN, USA",Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon - Fri11:00 AM -  7:00 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

South Jersey Dream Center,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/756,"Mission: South Jersey Dream Center helps break the vicious cycle of poverty by offering people options to change. Almost 250,000 pounds of food, clothing, diapers, etc. were distributed to people in need during the year as well as providing relevant training and mentoring. Vision: We value sharing God's unconditional love, goodness, and grace. We value engaging in relationship, partnership, and two-way giving. We value serving in and strengthening our local communities. We value being open and intentional about how to do things more effectively. Services: 1 out of 10 people in South Jersey live in poverty, according to the US Census. They lack the ability or money to provide for their basic needs. We exist to reach that 1. We actually believe the cycle of poverty can be broken over people’s lives. We believe that a sense of dignity and self-esteem can be restored. HOW We offer people options to change their status quo…from the inside out. To discover their God given purpose and value, and develop their full potential. To become a positive influence in their local communities. We start with helping out with food, clothing, household, baby, and hygiene items. Then begins the personal, spiritual, and professional training. We develop the whole person. Assistance Programs: Food, Clothing, Household and Baby Items, Training Food: It's almost shocking that anyone in America goes hungry, yet there are thousands of children and adults who do not get the meals they need to thrive. We seek to help the people we serve enjoy a food-secure future. We don't pre-bag our food. Our Food Distribution is set up like a grocery store, and we supply grocery carts for you to ""shop"" for the specific items that your family needs. Thanks to our Food Partners, we supply a variety of bread, pastries, fresh and local produce, personal hygiene items, canned and boxed goods, snacks, as well as diapers, dairy items and meat when available. For those with an indoor pet and can provide proof that they are spayed or neutered, we frequently have donated pet food and supplies. Clothing: Many people in our local neighborhoods find themselves in crisis or transition, and can't afford coats, shoes and clothing for their families. While visiting our Food Distribution, we invite our guests to shop at no cost in our Clothing Closet and select what they need. Shoppers are called in number order and are welcome to take a specified number of items, while supplies last. Every month we are cycling out older items to make room for new, and more seasonable items. The clothing we supply are gently used or new, in great condition, and for immediate use. Thanks to our Clothing Partners, we have shoes, handbags, coats, casual wear, children's wear, and much more. Household Items: Whether someone is starting over or going through crisis or transition, what makes a house a home are the simple things, but can also be in short supply when your funds are being stretched. Our desire is to help provide a sufficient and stable environment for people to raise a family and enjoy the basic necessities such as kitchenware, bedding, curtains and more. We supply lightly used household items in good condition, as they are made available to us. Baby Items: When resources are limited, many babies lack the appropriate clothing, diapers, and supplies to thrive during their crucial first years of life. It can be surprising to new parents just how many things you need to care for a little one. We are here to help. Our gently used clothing, equipment and supplies are available to our guests, free of charge, who have children of their own. We want to do all that we can to make sure the parents can focus their attention on caring for their little ones without the stress of not knowing how they will provide certain essentials for them. Training: What makes the South Jersey Dream Center different from many other agencies, is that while our guests are waiting to shop for their food and clothes, we offer voluntary workshops. Local professionals donate their time and expertise to offer a 45-minute presentation on relevant and easily applicable topics, such as job readiness, overcoming addictions, health, nutrition, fitness, finances and more. Each workshop is followed by a faith-based encouraging message from the Bible. We also offer a Discipleship Program that helps our guests develop a relationship with God and learn simple principles from the Bible to apply to their everyday lives. We believe these workshops and faith-based programs are the key elements in helping our guests build a strong foundation and a path toward a brighter tomorrow.","Clothing & Living Essentials, Children & Family Services, Hunger & Food Security",856-845-4500,contact@southjerseydreamcenter.org,https://www.southjerseydreamcenter.org/,"P.O.

Angels In Motion,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/811,"Mission: AIM is changing the way those suffering with the disease of addiction are treated one life at a time. Susan Long, LSW, LCADC, CTP, DRCC is in long term recovery and was a volunteer for AIM in Philadelphia for several years before starting the New Jersey Chapter with volunteer Kerry Sullivan, which primarily serves the Atlantic City/County local population. Since that time, AIM’s presence in Atlantic County has grown tremendously and is the largest grassroots non-profit organization serving this population in the county. Susan is joined in AIM leadership by Lisa Bee, who lost her son Mathew to addiction in 2017. Lisa has since been working hand-in-hand with members of the community and Angels in Motion to help those who still suffer to find solutions. Lisa brings compasssion, kindness, and love onto the streets and treats those that are served as family. Together, they provide strong leadership and oversight to a group of many dedicated volunteers that include Certified Peer Recovery Specialists (CPRS), social workers, and persons in long term recovery with lived experience of substance use disorder, homelessness, and mental health challenges. Services: Street Outreach The concept of AIM was formed three years ago when we started to reach out to people struggling with the disease of addiction in the city of Philadelphia and the surrounding ares. There are over 10,000 members, and over 100 active volunteers. Since AIM started I have become a Certified Recovery Specialist and this has become my full time job. AIM distributes over 1,500 blessing bags monthly consisting of non-perishable snacks to the homeless and those in active addiction. This is how we build trust and a relationship with each of them. We assist and transport over 100 people monthly to get into treatment, get to doctor’s appointments, obtain ID’s, get insurance reinstated and provide CRS services. Weekly Outreach Our weekly outreach takes place each Wednesday in an isolated parking on Kentucky Avenue in Atlantic City. We typically have over 100 people in line, to whom we serve meals, blessing bags, social services, clothing, & toiletries. We often schedule outreach on various days in addition to Wednesdays, which include luncheon outreach events in the park, Sunday Pleasantville outreach, and Holiday Outreach Days which include serving Holiday meals, blessing bags, social services, clothing (including hats, gloves, scarfs and coats in the Winter), & toiletries. Blessing Bags Our staple outreach engagement tool is a blessing bag. The blessing bags are extremely important as they are meaningful to our clients, and they are used as our initial engagement tool. These bags are a perfect way to make that first contact and start building trust with our angels on the streets. Each bag contains snacks, drinks, handmade note of encouragement, and an AIM resource pamphlet with information and phone numbers to call when seeking shelter, social services, medical assistance, or detox/treatment. ​ Recovery Support Services Recovery support services that are provided on a daily basis consist of providing treatment options and direct linkages, recovery housing, transportation, necessities, sober living funding (if and when funds are available) and connections to care.

Built with Love,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/820,"Mission: Provide new build-a-bears to children in need at various hospitals and local organizations. We've also supported the homeless population by supplying food, clothing, shelter, and other various needs. Built With Love, is a New Jersey Nonprofit Corporation and public charity founded to comfort children battling physical or emotional trauma. Since our inception, we've grown leaps and bounds due to community and overall support. What started with Build-a-Bears, has evolved into so much more. Services: With the grant we received and the public support, in addition to providing hundreds of brand new build-a-bears to local institutions, we were also able to fund a room at the Ronald McDonald House for one year. This means that any family that stays in our room throughout the year will not be responsible for paying. Build-A-Bear Our charity began by giving one sick little boy a build-a-bear in hopes he would find some comfort in it. From there we've expanded to purchasing and taking donations of brand new build-a-bears to distribute to local hospitals, institutions, or even struggling families that could use them. We've done hundreds of bears with each trip and do many of our deliveries around the holidays when families are away from home. Feeding the Homeless Our family and organization are committed to helping who we can, when we can. We often make home cooked meals at home, get out into our community, and distribute to those that need it the most. Many shelters and food kitchens don't offer these services on Sundays so we're trying to fill that void as best we can. Bagsagainstbullies We are running an anti-bullying campaign called Bags Against Bullies which will bring empathy education into classrooms and combat bullying at its core. Empathy Rocks is eight 45 minute lessons, one per month, that teach children about empathy through recent events in the United States. Students learn about what happened, and how empathy helped heal and solve problems afterward. At the end of each lesson they complete an art project, and after the final lesson a service learning project. After one year of the program: 100% of teachers reported an increase in kids acting empathetically without prompting 100% of teachers said students had more respect for people who are different from them 96% of teachers say they saw an improvement in classroom climate 87% of teachers reported a decrease in bullying 96% of students said they felt they learned something of value and will consider more other people’s feelings With bullying on the rise in U.S. schools and increasingly diverse classrooms and communities, the need for empathy has never been more important. Each year, more than 3.2 million students are bullied, while an estimated 160,000 students miss school for fear of being bullied. Bullying hurts everyone. It hurts the educational environment by affecting every child's ability to learn, it can cause lifelong anxiety and depression for victims, while others experience thoughts of suicide or self-harm. 1 in 10 kids drop out of school due to bullying Over 70% of kids say bullying is a problem 81% of bullying goes unreported In over 77% of aggressive incidents, bystanders did not intervene Because most bullying goes unreported, and so few kids intervene when witnessed, we have to empower children to help one another bring an end to bullying. If you have empathy for someone, and care about how they feel, it makes it extremely difficult to intentionally hurt them.

Food Bank of South Jersey,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/833,"Mission: The Food Bank of South Jersey exists to provide an immediate solution to the urgent problem of hunger by providing food to people in need, teaching them to eat nutritiously, and helping them to find sustainable ways to improve their lives. Services: Kids Cafe/Kidz Pack For after-school assistance, our Kids Cafe program supplies dinner and nutritious snacks in safe, supervised environments. For assistance on weekend, when school meals are not available, our Kidz Pack program bridges the gap. Every Friday during the school year, FBSJ provides at-risk school children with nutritionally-balanced grocery items to help sustain them over the weekend. This assures consistent nutrition for all and helps stretch the family budget. Twilight Harvest Through our Twilight Harvest program which includes a federal supplemental food program, FBSJ relieves the economic pressure that many seniors feel. Each month, we deliver boxes with food and ingredients directly to low-income senior complexes and living facilities. Seniors are able to prepare two weeks worth of balanced meals from our supplies, getting a timely boost that contributes to their physical and mental well-being. Summer Meals For assistance during the summer, our Summer Meals Program picks up where school feeding programs end. We supply breakfast and lunches Monday through Friday, for 10 summer weeks, to thousands of children attending camps, learning centers, and similar settings, so that consistent access to food is not jeopardized during the long summer recess. With the addition of the “Bus Stop Café” – a renovated and air conditioned school bus featuring a new interior design with a built-in dining room – children gather together to enjoy meals and socialize. The program offers peace of mind to parents, too – as it takes some of the burden of replacing school provided meals once summer begins. Hope Mobile/School Pantry The struggles of low-income families typically involve trade-offs on necessities. Far too often they are forced to make sacrifices on food, cutting back on the amount purchased or settling for low quality, less-nutritious items. We help families make ends meet through our partnerships with pantries, where they can obtain nutrient-dense food from a trusted community source. Because not every family lives close to one of our partner agencies or to a full-service grocery store, we launched our Hope Mobile, an 18-wheel tractor trailer that functions as a mobile food pantry. Each month, it transports thousands of pounds of shelf-stable foods, fresh produce, meat and dairy products to needy families, in designated locations known as ""food deserts"" throughout our service area. And through our School Pantry program, FBSJ works with school administrators and parent-teacher organizations to identify and directly assist families who can benefit most from deliveries of healthy, supplemental groceries. Health and Wellness The FBSJ Health and Wellness (H&W) department is FBSJ’s educational complement to our core feeding program. Through a combination of classroom instruction and cooking demonstration, H&W shares the value of nutrition awareness and empowers participants across our communities to adopt healthy eating behaviors. Cooking Matters® programs offered in partnership with Share Our Strength, consist of classes with content tailored for children, teens, and families. In partnership with Oldways, H&W offers an adult curriculum that embraces healthy, cultural eating traditions with courses such as A Taste of African Heritage and A Taste of Latin American Heritage. These hands-on lessons transfer skills that enable those with limited means to become smarter shoppers and to make nutritious meals from basic foods.",Hunger & Food Security,856-662-4884,info@foodbanksj.org,https://foodbanksj.org/,"1501 John Tipton Blvd, Pennsauken, NJ 08110, USA",Pennsauken,NJ,Closed; Mon - Fri10:30 AM -  6:30 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

New Jersey Tree Foundation,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/863,"Mission: The New Jersey Tree Foundation is a statewide nonprofit organization dedicated to planting trees in New Jersey’s most underserved neighborhoods, where the need is greatest. Through tree planting, volunteerism, and partnerships, we assist communities in improving their environment & quality of life. Services: Urban Airshed Reforestation Program The Urban Airshed Reforestation Program links tree planting in Camden, NJ, to improved air and water quality for city residents. Each year, the Urban Airshed Reforestation Program collaborates with residents and organizations to implement greening projects throughout Camden. Working in Camden since 2002, the impact of this program can be seen on many city streets. Renaissance Trees Program Through our Renaissance Trees Program, modeled after our successful Urban Airshed Reforestation Program, we plant trees with residents in Northern New Jersey cities of need. The goals of the Renaissance Trees Program are two-fold: increase the tree canopy cities such as Newark, Jersey City, and more; and empower residents to make positive changes in their own community. Hot, barren city streets are transformed into an urban oasis by planting cooling shade trees. City residents, who sometimes have never spoken to their neighbors, come together for the first time to plant and maintain their trees. Residents share hoses, mulch, and hand tools to water, prune, and support their new urban forest. Many residents plant small flower gardens in the tree pit, hang bird feeders in their trees, and decorate their trees with lights during the holidays. Trees become the one asset that neighbors share and enjoy, and they create a sense of well-being. New Jersey's Living Memorial - A Grove of Remembrance In spring 2003, the NJ Tree Foundation planted one tree for each New Jersey victim of 9/11, at Liberty State Park in Jersey City. Today, more than 750 trees and thousands of shrubs and perennials make up this Living Memorial. The impact of these trees on a 10.8-acre tract speaks loudly of New Jersey’s loss. The Grove of Remembrance is being maintained entirely by volunteers. Green Streets Each season the NJ Tree Foundation partners with the New Jersey State Parole Board to employ individuals under parole supervision to serve as a tree planting crew. The parolees chosen for this opportunity are learning skills specific to the industry - tree planting, identification, and maintenance - as well as work skills sought by employers in all fields. The Crew Supervisor is a graduate of the Hall and is employed full-time by the NJ Tree Foundation. With a trained tree crew in place, the NJ Tree Foundation bids on contract work in order to employ the parolees for a few additional weeks, and to acquire the funding necessary to make the Green Streets program self-sustaining. Any profit produced through Green Streets is used to support the NJ Tree Foundation's community-based tree planting programs which provide trees for free to residents of cities in need. Education Outreach Over the years, the NJ Tree Foundation has delivered environmental stewardship programs to multigenerational audiences. In response to growing urgency in the need to disseminate the skills and applicable knowledge necessary to create systemic change and sustainability, the organization has launched a dedicated Education Outreach Program in 2024. Today, NJ Tree Foundation is bringing its message of personal and community empowerment to more neighborhoods through school, recreation and adult education programs.",Environment,,,https://njtrees.org/,"108 Pine Cone Trail, Medford, NJ 08055, USA",Medford,NJ,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success

Veterans of Foreign Wars - New Jersey,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/881,"Mission: The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States is a nonprofit veterans service organization comprised of eligible veterans and military service members from the active, guard and reserve forces. Vision: We trace our roots back to 1899 when veterans of the Spanish-American War (1898) and the Philippine Insurrection (1899-1902) founded local organizations to secure rights and benefits for their service. Many arrived home wounded or sick. There was no medical care or veterans' pension for them, and they were left to care for themselves. In their misery, some of these veterans banded together and formed organizations that would eventually band together and become known as the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. After chapters were formed in Ohio, Colorado and Pennsylvania, the movement quickly gained momentum. Today, membership stands at more than 1.4 million members of the VFW and its Auxiliary. Our voice was instrumental in establishing the Veterans Administration, development of the national cemetery system, in the fight for compensation for Vietnam vets exposed to Agent Orange and for veterans diagnosed with Gulf War Syndrome. In 2008, we won a long-fought victory with the passing of a GI Bill for the 21st Century, giving expanded educational benefits to America's active duty service members, and members of the guard and reserves, fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. We were the driving force behind the Veterans Access and Accountability Act of 2014, and continually fight for improved VA medical centers services for women veterans. The VFW's legislative advocacy efforts were also the driving force behind the passage of the 2019 Blue Water Navy Veteran Act, and the passage of the 2022 Honoring Our PACT Act, which the VFW considers one of the most significant pieces of veterans legislation in history. Besides helping fund the creation of the Vietnam, Korean War, World War II and Women in Military Service memorials, in 2005 the VFW became the first veterans' organization to contribute to building the new Disabled Veterans for Life Memorial, which opened in November 2010. And in 2015, we became the first supporter of the Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial which broke ground in July of 2022.

Tackle Hunger,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/876,"Mission: For over 30 years, the Souper Bowl of Caring movement has been inspiring people across the nation to tackle hunger in their local communities. We coordinate efforts to tackle hunger through our digital platform of fundraising services created to support food charities large and small. Mobilizing grassroots resources including churches, schools, civic groups and caring individuals, this movement has created over $193 million worth of support that stays completely local. Over the last three years alone, thousands of groups collected over $25 million in dollars and food donations for hunger-relief charities across the country. Over that period, our organization took $1 specifically donated to our mission and created over $18 for local food charities. Services: Souper Bowl of Caring The annual Souper Bowl of Caring event harnesses the energy of the Big Game. Its vision is to transform the Big Game into a nationwide movement inspiring people to give locally and make a collective impact on hunger. People collect monetary and food donations traditionally during the weeks leading up to and after Super Bowl Sunday. All of the money and food is then given directly to local food charities of the group's choice. The Tackle Hunger Map The Tackle Hunger Map is an equitable nationwide database of the real time needs of food charities across the country. Using the color-coded Tackle Hunger Map, communities can quickly respond to the immediate needs of food charities in their communities. Regardless of size, the Tackle Hunger Map features all food charities in an equitable fashion: if they are feeding people, they can go on the Tackle Hunger Map. Because the Tackle Hunger Map uses geolocation, anyone visiting the map can find help if they need it or support their closest food charity. The Tackle Hunger Challenge Partnering with the NFL Alumni, the Tackle Hunger Challenge asks: what if everyone watching a game donates just $1 or 1 can of food to a local food charity? It would be a gamechanger!

Locks of Love,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/189,"Mission: Locks of Love is devoted to helping every child suffering from medical hair loss, thus we do not discriminate as to the cause of hair loss. We list the following information in an attempt to explain types of hair loss and specific needs of individual recipients. Services: Children must apply to Locks of Love in order to be considered for a hairpiece. Application includes a nomination form, photo of the child without a hairpiece, doctor's diagnosis, most recent tax return, essay about the child nominated, and two letters of recommendation. In order to get a replacement hairpiece, each applicant must re-apply with Locks of Love. The Board of Directors reviews the completed file for consideration. The President of the Board recommends approvals. Recipients begin the production process in their homes by making a plaster mold of the child's head. Locks of Love provides the molding materials via UPS. These include an instructional video, a water-transfer pen, aprons, plaster strips and a hair ring, from which the child can choose his or her new hair color. From this mold, a fit cap is produced to check the vacuum seal. Once the fit cap is approved, the actual hairpiece is assembled by hand. The entire process takes approximately four months. Locks of Love depends on monetary donations from private foundations and the general public to cover the costs of production and shipping for these hairpieces. The organization receives ponytails through the mail, which allows us to reduce our production costs. The target population for this program is children 21 and under suffering from long-term medical hair loss. Qualifying diagnoses include the following: alopecia areata (totalis and universalis), severe burns to the scalp, radiation treatment to the brain stem as a treatment for cancer, loose anagen syndrome, etc.","Children & Family Services, Human & Social Services",(561) 833-7332,info@locksoflove.org,https://locksoflove.org/,"234 Southern Blvd, West Palm Beach, FL 33405, USA",West Palm Beach,FL,Closed; Mon - Fri11:00 AM -  7:00 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success
Justice and Mercy International,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/208,"Mission: Justice & Mercy International (JMI) is a faith-based, non-profit 501(c)(3) organization that exists to make justice personal for the poor, the orphaned and the forgotten of the world. JMI primarily works in Moldova in Eastern Europe and in the Amazon region of Brazil and we do our work through programs that have the Good News of Jesus at their core. Services: Moldova Orphan & Vulnerable Child Sponsorships: Moldova is one of the poorest countries of the former Soviet Union. It is ground zero for human trafficking in Europe. JMI targets its services toward orphaned & abandoned children in Moldova. We follow a strategic plan that includes: • Creating enduring relationships with children in orphanages & shelters through mission trips • Strengthening those connections through a sponsorship program, allowing Americans to invest long-term in a specific child • Providing transitional living homes for children with no families in order to keep them safe, help complete their education and provide them with vocational skills. Moldova Transitional Living Program: The government institutional care of orphaned and abandoned children lasts until they reach the age of 16, or the U.S. equivalent of the freshman year of high school. They are then on their own with no family, no home, and no support. JMI’s transitional living program is an effort to meet the needs of these vulnerable young people. Moldova Transitional Living Non-residential Sponsorship Program: Through this program you can support a needy young person who has been discharged from an orphanage and needs help to survive on her own. Your monthly gift will be used for higher education, renting a room from a family, food, healthcare and other needs. Amazon Special Needs Kids Sponsorship: Through our Special Needs Kids Sponsorship these “least of these” are cared for, and their families encouraged, through regular visits, help with food and medicines, and the knowledge that someone loves them. Sponsors will receive monthly reports and photos of the children they support. Amazon Emergency Food Aid Program: Half of each year in the Amazon is the rainy season. The first quarter of the year often brings desolation to the Jungle people in the form of massive flooding. Many villages will be underwater and many more cut off from being able to find food. JMA is one of just a few organizations that bring relief to these starving people, providing food bags and food items. Through the work of JMA many communities have begun to realize that God loves and cares for them and many have turned to Him as their Savior. Amazon Pastor Training Program: Our jungle pastor’s conference is at the center of all that we do. As we train and equip these precious pastors and their wives, we care for their villages and their people. Often needs are discovered through our relationships with local pastors that are then met through our ongoing programs. Those needs may be for local school to be built, for a child with special needs to be cared for, for emergency food aid to be delivered during the rainy season, for an ongoing children’s program like Pepe or Open Arms for preschool or school age children. We also take mission trip teams to the villages of our pastors to help with evangelism, medical care and home visits.","Faith-Based, International",(615) 472-7455,info@justiceandmercy.org,https://justiceandmercy.org/,"304 44th Avenue North, Nashville, TN 37209, USA",Nashville,TN,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success
Our Place Nashville,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/222,"Mission: Our Place Nashville empowers adults with developmental disabilities (“friends”) by providing homes that are affordable, work that is meaningful, and inclusive communities to surround them for a lifetime. We partner with other non-profit organizations to provide brick-and-mortar housing, called Friendship Houses. We create a rich and rewarding interdependent living environment by placing friends alongside graduate students from Vanderbilt University Divinity School and other graduate programs. We help our Friendship House residents find employment and volunteer opportunities that give them a sense of accomplishment, independence and community. We are advocates for them and for their families, serving as a resource for information about the benefits and services available to them, and involving them in the transition and acclimation process experienced by their differently abled loved one. We believe adults with developmental disabilities deserve a sense of community comprised of home, work, and friendships that will sustain them as independently and affordably as possible. We believe Our Place Nashville can become a model through the city and the country for providing community for adults with developmental disabilities. Services: Creating Housing Opportunities Our Place Nashville is creating opportunity by partnering with a broad spectrum of groups. Our primary partners are two of Nashville's nonprofits that focus on providing affordable housing: Urban Housing Solutions and Woodbine Community Organization. We have two Friendship Houses up and running, with three more to open by mid-2020. In addition to having graduate students live alongside our friends with developmental disabilities, we are going to begin integrating seniors into our model, with the seniors providing the same kind of support and friendship the graduate students do -- and all doing so, of course, on a volunteer basis. Supporting Families / Facilitating Employment Our Place Nashville comes alongside families and their loved ones with developmental disabilities and provides support on how best to prepare their adult sons and daughters for interdependent living. Instilling the belief early on that interdependent living is possible, while helping to provide basic skills in self-care, cooking, entering a community, or volunteering is central to preparing a friend for interdependent living. Individuals with developmental disabilities are proven assets to employers. We are communicating that message to prospective employers, helping to open doors to employment. We are partnering with a number of other non-profit groups in this effort as we have the same goal of equipping the employee and the employer so that both can have a rewarding experience. This involves talking with small (and some large) business owners in Davidson County and Greater Nashville, from The Nashville Sounds to the Nashville Humane Society and Saddle Up! Expanding Opportunities for Inclusion Our Place Nashville provides weekly life skill classes on Monday evenings. These classes meet at a Metro Parks community center. Each class has volunteer instructors from the community. Topics are varied, both serious and fun, and attendance varies, giving attendees the chance to meet and become friends with new people. We have a weekly book club that meets on Wednesday afternoons at a neighborhood cafe/bakery, again led by community volunteers. Our Place Nashville has partnered with another nonprofit that provides our residents with weekly arts-related workshops, meeting an area church with showcase performances at a music venue every two months. We have weekly community dinners at each Friendship House. We also sponsor social events, from outings to the zoo, cook-outs, movie and game nights, volunteer opportunities as a group (e.g., monthly neighborhood clean-up), and seasonal parties. Building Awareness By providing the opportunity for graduate students to live with individuals with developmental disabilities, Our Place Nashville is creating change agents. These are men and women who go across the country when they graduate, knowing first-hand all of the gifts this marginalized population brings to the table as well as wanting to help others – from parishioners to colleagues to students – celebrate these individuals. We speak at churches and conferences, both in and out of Nashville, as well as consulting with other nonprofits wanting to do similar work. Maintaining a Non-Profit Running Our Place Nashville requires creating possibility for new housing, raising funds, meeting with prospective residents and their families, managing volunteers and interns, responding to inquiries, speaking engagements, attending conferences/workshops, developing relationships and partnerships, providing support to students and friends living in our Friendship Houses, maintaining social media, and administrative work. It involves keeping records, banking, accounting, printing, mailing, creating marketing materials and giving interviews. Of late, it means expanding our portfolio to include seniors, and creating the criteria and supports needed to include this population in our model. Our Place Nashville also spends a good amount of time building new relationships and nurturing ongoing relationships -- these relationships become partnerships, and partnerships are the cornerstone of all parts of our work.",Disability Services,(615) 651-0060,carolyn.naifeh@ourplacenashville.org,https://www.ourplacenashville.org/,,,,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success

And he will do so in a “having lived it” way, equipping you with knowledge and practical applications of that knowledge…not from a clinical opinion, fashioned by people who have never “been there”, but from a “been there, done that” point of view instead. And discuss using the R. E. A. L. approach when dealing with the homeless…RESPECT, ENCOURAGE, ACCEPT and LOVE. A Place Called Home The Tomlin House, Opening spring of 2020!Halfway house, sober house, program house or transitional housing, temporary housing, emergency housing, etc. When it comes to those who are struggling to survive life on the streets, these terms are used quite often. However, the term you rarely hear…if at all…is HOME…except to describe their condition and then “less” is added. It’s time to change that. From the beginning part of my dream was to provide a next step opportunity for our friends. One that would move them off the streets…not into a house…but a home…and allow them to begin the process of recovery, grow stronger, heal and eventually be ready to stand on their own two feet. “A Place Called Home” will give them that opportunity. We are in the very early stages, but are so excited about the future. This will be a radical departure from the way things have been done in the past, however, we believe this change is long overdue. The time has come to stop getting them ready for a “house” and start getting them ready to go “home”.

The Nashville Food Project,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/550,"Mission: The Nashville Food Project brings people together to grow, cook and share nourishing food, with the goals of cultivating community and alleviating hunger in our city. Services: Meals Program TNFP’s Meals Program cooks and shares thousands of made-from-scratch, nutritious meals and snacks each week in collaboration with anti-poverty and community building organizations in our city. By aligning food support with these vital programs and services -- such as job training, after school programs, ESL classes, senior services, domestic violence shelter, and GED prep, among others -- we are able to enhance the impact of partners' work while simultaneously providing access to the basic need of nutritious food. These meals are significantly supported by TNFP’s food recovery efforts, through which we collect excess produce and other perishable foods from local farms, grocery stores, and restaurants. We work directly with local food vendors to recover the excess foods they cannot sell, providing hundreds of pounds of fresh ingredients for our meals, while greatly reducing the amount of food wasted in our community. Urban Agriculture Program TNFP’s Urban Agriculture Program includes vibrant production, community and market garden programming. In production gardens, volunteers support all aspects of growing organic produce for our kitchens, including turning the ground, planting seeds, weeding and harvesting fresh produce. In three community gardens, we provide a space for participants to grow food for themselves and their families, sharing resources of lands, tools, and garden training. And through an innovative market garden program, Growing Together, we support New Americans from farming backgrounds in growing produce to sell for personal income and building community food security along the way. Beyond the value of their earnings, farmers are able to reconnect with the practice of growing food, equipping participants with additional tools to improve their well-being through meaningful work. In these gardens, we are creating space for deep connection to the land and to diverse community-building strategies - places where both people and the land can heal. Food Recovery Much of our food recovery efforts are through ongoing donation partnerships with local grocers, farmers, markets and restaurants. Every day, we’re astounded by the generosity and creativity of these partners, who share not just their ‘seconds’ but their best. From a grocery bag filled with the first harvest of a backyard gardener, to over 20,000 pounds of fresh, never-frozen meat recovered from a local meat conference -- each bit of food shared is vital in supporting our mission to alleviate hunger and cultivate community.

Veteran's PATH Inc.,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/565,"Mission: Veteran’s PATH provides high quality, veteran-specific mindfulness training and support to build inner strength and resilience. Services: Evidence-Based Mindfulness Training Accelerated Mind Performance (AMP™) Training teaches skills for developing mental resilience and agility. The online course meets 1 hour weekly for 6 weeks of instruction. Veterans learn the science of mind-body dynamics, effects of stress on the nervous system, and how to re-engage system regulation and attention after a disruption. PTSD is a disorder of non-recovery from trauma. The combination of mindfulness training and peer support helps veterans monitor internal stress and maintain self-regulation of the nervous system and emotions, skills critical to self-awareness and self-compassion. Research shows a mindfulness program supported by AMP instructional methods found a 50% reduction in arousal regulation, a 30% improvement in concentration, significant improvement in cortisol levels, and 100% self-reported improvement in cognitive, physiological, and relational function. Our instructors are veterans who teach strategies to their peers that lead to a healthier quality of life. BRAVE™ Retreats BRAVE stands for Breathwork Recalibration And Veteran Empowerment. The retreat invites women veterans to a 5-day intensive in-person gathering followed by a 12-week practice period online (in groups and individually with Veteran’s PATH facilitators) and ending with a 3-day reconvening in-person. BRAVE supports women veterans struggling with reintegration issues that can include post-traumatic stress, military sexual trauma, substance abuse, and family/caregiver matters. We integrate meditation and mindfulness practices into a disciplined, daily routine that is also full of fun and laughter so that, together, veterans can open up about their experiences and heal inner conflicts they never thought possible. The BRAVE retreats are life changing and offer an opportunity to connect with other female veterans in a safe and supportive environment. Lifetime friendships are formed! AMP Dojo Naval Special Warfare veterans are taking initiative in the fight against suicide by identifying, researching, and validating new mental health treatments. One of the most promising is psychedelic-assisted therapy (“PAT”), which continues to headline advances in mental health treatments with ongoing research in hundreds of universities and clinical trials. Veteran’s PATH does not directly fund PAT, but our AMP Dojo meditation program serves as a critical element in stabilizing and integrating the therapeutic impact of an innovative treatment like PAT. AMP Dojo helps veterans undergoing PAT to integrate psychedelic-induced insights, including deconstructing faulty beliefs, restructuring attitudes, challenging assumptions, and healing traumas stored in the body/mind. Learning meditation plays a very important role in successful PAT, and AMP Dojo helps sustain lasting positive change. Wilderness Retreats Veteran’s PATH wilderness retreats offer veterans multi-day journeys based on mindfulness practice and activities such as whitewater rafting, rock climbing, hiking, or skiing/snowboarding. These life-changing and life-affirming opportunities require energy, courage and dedication. Time in nature can reduce anxiety and depression and decrease PTSD symptoms in veterans. This is a serious commitment, so only apply if you are ready to step forward towards the changes your heart is longing for. While programs can be challenging, they are filled with fun, laughter, connection, purpose, and renewal. Through coming together with other veterans, in a safe and beautiful natural setting, veterans are given the time, support, and new skills to focus on the personal changes needed to move forward from military service into the post-military life that they envision and create. Our retreats are open to active-duty service members and veterans of all branches of the military and all eras.","Mental Health, Veteran & Military",,info@veteranspath.org,https://veteranspath.org,"PO Box 38546  Colorado Springs, CO 80937",PO Box 38546 Colorado Springs,CO,By Appointment Only; Mon - FriClosed; SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

It is time-limited, but service rich and intensive, designed for clients with deep but nonpermanent needs. This is a clustered site program, and, because we own the program property, we are able to operate our program with minimal barriers for survivors. Our survivor-focused program enhances our residents’ autonomy by nurturing their capacity to live independently from their abusers, establish self-sufficiency, and ultimately secure permanent housing.","Children & Family Services, Emergency & Safety, Housing & Homelessness",615-256-5959,office@maryparrish.org,http://www.maryparrish.org/,"P.O.

Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation - Greater Nashville Chapter,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/610,"Mission: Susan G. Komen is the world’s largest breast cancer organization, funding more breast cancer research since our inception in 1982 than any other nonprofit outside of the federal government while providing real-time help to those facing the disease. Komen has funded more than $988 million in research and provided more than $2.2 billion for screening, education, treatment and psychosocial support programs serving millions of people in more than 60 countries worldwide. Komen was founded by Nancy G. Brinker, who promised her sister, Susan G. Komen, that she would end the disease that claimed Suzy’s life. That promise has become Komen’s promise to all people facing breast cancer. Services: Research & Scientific Programs Komen has a strong commitment to supporting research that seeks to prevent and cure breast cancer through better approaches for early detection and diagnosis; understanding metastasis and recurrence; and developing novel therapies for all stages of breast cancer, with the overarching goal of supporting work that has significant potential to lead to new treatments and technologies that will reduce the number of breast cancer deaths in the U.S. by 50% by 2026. Since its founding in 1982, Komen’s research investments have contributed to major advances in breast cancer science. The progress has been significant. Today, we know breast cancer is more than a single disease, but instead is a collection of diseases. We have a better understanding of the genetics of breast cancer and the critical need to tailor screening, diagnosis, treatment and prevention strategies to individuals through advances in personalized or precision medicine. Komen’s research programs are guided by a scientific advisory board of the world’s leaders in breast cancer research, oncology and advocacy. The scientific advisory board assists Komen in setting its research strategy and prioritizing its research investment. The Komen Scholars , a group of 60 accomplished scientists, clinicians and patient advocates, lead and participate in Komen’s world-class scientific peer review process. Our Advocates in Science bring the patient voice to Komen’s research programs, emphasizing urgency and patient impact. Community Health Programs Our community health programs ensure access to and utilization of timely, high-quality care for all by providing breast cancer education, screening and treatment services for those who need them most. Through local and national community needs assessments, Komen identifies unmet needs in communities and supports localized community health programs to fill these gaps. Since our founding in 1982, Komen has provided more than $2.2 billion to fund screening, education, treatment and psychosocial support programs. Global Initiatives Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, worldwide, and the number of cases is increasing in nearly every country. The number of new breast cancer cases has more than doubled around the world in the last three decades, with the highest increases observed in low- and middle-income countries. Breast cancer is also the leading cause of cancer death in these countries, with more than 600,000 deaths expected in 2018. These trends are concerning, which is why Komen works tirelessly to provide support to breast health programs worldwide. It takes collaboration and strong partnerships to make a global impact. Komen strives to serve as a “bridge” – collaborating with international nonprofits, corporations, and ministries of health to bring together people and organizations to develop programs that are tailored to the specific needs of the community and sensitive to cultural differences. Advocacy Susan G. Komen advocates act as the voice of the more than 3.5 million breast cancer survivors and the 1 in 8 women in the U.S. who will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime. Our patient advocacy efforts are broad and deep, and we work on multiple levels to ensure the voice of breast cancer survivors and those living with metastatic breast cancer are heard in all that we do. In order to achieve our mission, we believe scientific progress and community programming must be complemented by sound public policy and advocacy. Through government action, broad, systemic, lasting change can be made in the fight against breast cancer. This means that Komen—as a patient advocacy organization with first-hand knowledge of how breast cancer touches local communities—must engage policymakers and government as partners in our efforts to end breast cancer forever. To advance our policy priorities, Komen works with our volunteers, partners, researchers and friends in communities across the U. S., to ensure breast cancer is a priority among policymakers at the federal, state and local levels and to increase access to affordable, high-quality breast health and cancer care services.","Advocacy, Health",615-928-2269,info@komen.org,https://www.komen.org/community/tennessee/,"2131 Bandywood Drive suite 200, Nashville, TN 37215, USA",Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon - Fri11:00 AM - 12:00 AM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

The majority of the ACPD's annual budget goes to pay personnel salary.

However, as modern law enforcement tasks continue to become more complex and the City and State continue to struggle with their budgets, the Atlantic City Police Department, similar to police departments across the country, has increasing needs to stay current in training, technology and equipment, as well as communication and partnership efforts with the community/visitors in conjunction with the Cites and States initiatives to improve Atlantic City image as being “Clean and Safe”.

Music for Seniors,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/476,"Mission: COMMUNITY OUTREACH Music for Seniors (MFS) fosters connections between individuals of all ages: music is our vehicle. We accomplish our mission through: 1) Outreach delivered directly to senior groups in recreational and care settings at community and residential locations; 2) public monthly Concerts performed at accessible venues across our service area; and Live Performance Learning Labs which are series of group lessons in instrument performance, now offering ukulele, harmonica and percussion. We enlist over 200 local musicians to assist us in achieving our mission, which we accomplish through the three distinct programs plus an intergenerational initiative detailed below. We offer all musicians a per-program stipend or honorarium for their participation as MFS’ Outreach program facilitators, Concert performers or Learning Lab teaching artists. Compensating musicians for their participation supports the arts ecosystem and helps to ensure that our mission is achieved through offering outstanding programs. LIVE PERFORMANCE LEARNING LABS In 2017 we launched the MFS Live Performance Learning Labs (LL) - series of inter-generational group music classes offered at locations throughout our service area. Qualified teaching artists lead Learning Labs in Ukulele, Percussive Arts and Harmonica performance. In 2018, we expanded this program to include a dance LL, offering “Folk Dance to Live Music,” teaching traditional Eastern European folk dances. In 2019 we welcomed Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Vanderbilt University as our LL partner. LLs are multi-week series of sessions featuring 1 to 1.5 hours of active hands-on learning, with each session building upon what was learned in the prior sessions. Instruments are loaned or gifted (if harmonicas) to participants and all materials are provided free of charge. Our inter-generational approach is designed to accommodate those seniors who may rely on a younger individual to provide transportation or special caregiving needs. A granddaughter, son, care partner or driver, for instance, is encouraged to stay and participate alongside their senior companion. FREE DAYTIME CONCERT SERIES Music for Seniors produces a public FREE Daytime Concert Series for area seniors, their care partners, families and friends. We enlist the help of area arts partners and other organizations, who offer venues and, sometimes, performing artists. By offering these one-hour monthly concerts March through December at a variety of venues across our service area, almost everyone has a concert “in their neighborhood” at least once during our season. Due to traditionally late performance times of most concerts, driving at night and other possible obstacles outlined in the “Programs” introduction above, our concerts are always free to the public and always occurs during a weekday. Senior centers, residence communities and groups often travel on vans or buses to attend, and independent older adults drive themselves to concerts strategically scheduled to conclude just before or to begin just after lunch. Many of our regular attendees combine a lunch outing with the concert, providing a fun, active, arts-filled day. The concerts feature local artists of renown including soloists, ensembles and choral groups performing a wide range of musical genres - from classical to bluegrass, R&B to swing, and everything in-between! Music for Seniors connects area musicians with older adults through live and interactive music programs designed to engage, entertain and educate seniors - promoting health and wellbeing, reducing isolation and enriching the lives of all participants, musicians and seniors alike. We believe that arts organizations are obligated to provide vibrant, affordable and accessible programming for all of us, including to meet the special needs of older adults. Our mission mandates this. Services: ""Music Connecting Generations"" initiative MFS believes there is great value in learning through intergenerational activities. We seek to include youth and student participants in all aspects of our Outreach, Concert and Learning Labs programming – including youth participants as performers, audience members and students. This initiative ultimately raises awareness and provides enrichment for both generations: youth may better understand older adults, their unique needs and the value they still offer to society; seniors may be energized by the vitality and exuberance of youth. Youth Concert performers may include soloists, bands, orchestras and choirs composed of individuals under the age of 18. These performances are always followed by short informal “meet and greet” sessions. Providing this unique interactive opportunity proves beneficial for both the youth and the seniors: student musicians have expanded opportunities for performing, community service, and social engagement with older adults in their own community; and senior audience members – many of whom may have limited opportunities to connect with young people – are offered these occasions for revitalizing and enriching experiences. Virtual Programs COVID-19 has halted our live and in-person programs. In response, we now offer free weekly Virtual Outreach Programs and Learning Labs: each Monday there is a unique music program for singing along; each Friday, a new Learning Lab session. Our MPs and Teaching Artists record from home. MFS’ promotes them on social media, Eventbrite and e-blasts, with access to a YouTube link for each program. The unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic has raised our awareness acutely. Seniors unable to leave their homes or care communities experience this level of social isolation 24/7. So we have resolved to continue virtual programs extending beyond COVID-19 by videoing MFS’ monthly live Concerts and posting them – taking what we have learned from this experience to expand access indefinitely into the future.","Arts & Culture, Seniors",(615) 330-1937,connect@musicforseniors.org,https://musicforseniors.org/,"161 Rains Ave, Nashville, TN 37203, USA",Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon - Fri10:00 AM -  7:00 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

Matthew 25,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/571,"Mission: We empower homeless veterans and men to recapture happiness, fulfillment and independence. We believe that all men deserve HOUSING, HELP AND HOPE on their road to recovery. Vision: As a Christian nonprofit, Matthew 25 draws deeply from the life and teachings of Christ. Our work and mission are founded on His lessons of love, compassion and hospitality. It is out of a conviction in these teachings that we seek to offer Christ-centered care to our brothers facing the despair and hardships of poverty, homelessness and addiction. By doing so to “the least of these,” we join in Christ’s mission to offer help and hope to a broken and hurting world. More than a shelter, we are a Nashville-based, residential facility that provides Housing, Help and Hope to homeless men in need. Our service-intensive transitional housing program offers a safe, sober and supportive living environment for men wanting to turn their lives around. We serve these men daily by providing beds, meals, counseling, job placement services and more. Services: TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM Our service-intensive transitional housing program offers men comprehensive supportive services that enable them to return to independent living and obtain employment. In addition to beds and meals, we bridge the gap from homelessness to permanent housing by providing case management, employment and housing placement assistance, substance abuse recovery support, as well as life and social skills development and training. We operate with four key initiatives in mind for our men: Learn, Work, Save, and Progress. To be accepted into our program, men must be referred by a partner agency and show devotion to turning their lives around. Our men are assigned a case manager who will develop an individualized service plan, targeting goals that should be reached prior to and after leaving the program. PROGRESSIVE HOUSING PROGRAM Our Progressive Housing Program is built for men who have completed a transitional housing program, but may not be ready for completely independent living. While not as intensive or structured as our transitional program, progressive housing offers men assistance and guardrails to stay on track as they move towards the goal of permanent housing. This is an ideal program for men who (1) are doing well in recovery, but feel they can still benefit from a small degree of structure and accountability, or (2) have a significant barrier to housing such as an eviction or felony, and could benefit from case management to help work through these issues. AFTERCARE CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM Our Aftercare Case Management Program is for veterans who were previously homeless and are transitioning into permanent housing from programs such as GPD or the VA’s Healthcare for Homeless Veterans Contracted Residential Services Program. We also accept and assist veterans who are coming from non-VA transitional housing programs. This program aims to improve retention of housing by providing veterans with individualized case management, providing knowledge, referrals and other components to help the veteran thrive once housing is secured. Men receive home visits at least once every three months, as well as education in finance and budgeting, tenants right and lease agreements, and meal/food security planning.","Drug & Alcohol Treatment, Faith-Based, Housing & Homelessness",(615) 383-9577,mmiller@matthew25nashville.org,https://www.matthew25nashville.org/,"625 Benton Ave, Nashville, Tennessee, United States",Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon - Fri10:00 AM -  6:00 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

We create positive change in the lives of individuals and communities through a ministry of service. Vision: Creating Positive Change Services: Developmental Disability Services Designed to provide quality in-home and non-residential support for individuals with developmental disabilities, Volunteers of America's Supportive Living Program is comprised of a network of small neighborhood homes in Middle and West Tennessee, Southern Indiana and Northern Kentucky. The program empowers individuals to stay in their communities while receiving case management, transportation, assistance and support. Homeless and Housing Services Volunteers of America Mid-States provides housing and services to homeless families in Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky. In Louisville we operate the city's oldest family emergency shelter for homeless families. In Lexington we provide scattered-site, neighborhood-based transitional housing program for homeless and marginally-housed families. All of our homeless and housing services work with the families to build a strong foundation of self-sustainability and provide comprehensive and individualized case management.

Our services link veterans with employment training, affordable housing, and other resources that help them reintegrate into their communities. Health Services Volunteers of America is the largest provider of HIV medical case management services in the state of Kentucky.

Determined Health employs trained Community Health Worker's who engage with the residents at increased risk of poor health by providing care coordination, offering support for chronic disease management, navigation of community resources, empowering individuals to make health decisions, community outreach, and increased health education. Restorative Justice The criminal justice system asks what laws have been broken and what punishment is deserved. Restorative Justice asks what harm has been done, who is responsible, and how can that harm be repaired? The juvenile, victim, and trained counselors come together and focuses on making amends, repairing harm and building brighter futures. Young people who participate in VOA's Restorative Justice process are half as likely to commit a future offense. Victims of crimes report they feel closure and healing from being fully engaged in the discussion. Specialized VOA case managers work to stop youth from reoffending while making victims feel more respected and whole. Restorative Justice is an alternative to the overcrowding crisis facing our prison system and youth detention centers. And it saves taxpayers’ dollars – every single year-long detention for a youth in Kentucky currently costs more than $70,000. Restorative Justice is vastly more affordable – and more effective.

Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/810,"Mission: AFTD’s mission is to improve the quality of life of people affected by FTD and drive research to a cure. We work every day to advance: Research. We promote and fund research toward diagnosis, treatment, and a cure. Awareness. We stimulate greater public awareness and understanding. Support. We provide information and support to those directly impacted. Education. We promote and provide education for healthcare professionals. Advocacy. We advocate for research and appropriate, affordable services. Services: Comstock Grants In 2009, AFTD established the Respite Care Financial Assistance program to alleviate some of the financial burden people experience while navigating an FTD diagnosis. The initiative has since evolved into the Comstock Grant program, which provides direct assistance up to $500 for each grant to people living with a diagnosis and current care partners. The Quality of Life grant helps persons diagnosed access services or supports that directly address their needs or interests, while the Respite grant can be used by care partners to tend to their physical and emotional well-being. Grants can also assist with the cost of traveling to AFTD's Education Conference or other FTD-related educational events. During the 2023 fiscal year, AFTD distributed 748 Comstock Grants to help people in need. Support AFTDs HelpLine, accessible via email and phone, is often the initial touchpoint for people seeking more information about FTD. Monitored by on-staff social workers, the HelpLine offers guidance on such ways to locate providers with FTD experience, manage language and behavior symptoms, and access community support. Offering translation services for more than 200 languages, the HelpLine aided 3,379 people during fiscal year 2023. Our support groups are a vital resource for the people we serve, each one organized and led by volunteers who are trained and supported by AFTD staff. At the close of fiscal year 2023, 102 AFTD support group volunteers were leading 77 groups. Annually, we publish multiple resources to share updates about FTD research, available support services, care management options, and engagement opportunities. As we assess the evolving needs of a growing community, we increase accessibility to vital FTD information by refining and translating our core materials. FTD Research and Drug Discovery As a leader in advancing the science of FTD, AFTD works with a diverse, global community to further the discovery of biomarkers and the development of effective therapies. We also inform a growing network of researchers and clinicians about the needs of people living with FTD, while empowering all who are impacted to become informed volunteer research participants. Through programs such as our AFTD Pilot Grant awards and Holloway Postdoctoral Fellowship, we are fostering early-career scientists engaged in basic, clinical, and translational research to discover underlying biological mechanisms of neurodegenerative disease and identify novel therapeutic approaches for further evaluation. In collaboration with peer organizations, we are investing in ambitious studies seeking to develop tools and technologies to improve diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and effectively treat FTD. Awareness AFTD seeks to promote a greater understanding among the general public and key stakeholders within communities about the unique nature and challenges brought about by an FTD diagnosis, and the crucial need for support and access to resources for those who are coping with it. We work with a growing number of volunteers who are engaged in raising awareness of FTD and our mission in a number of different ways, including Meet & Greets, table settings, interviews with media outlets, and meeting with community healthcare professionals. Many of our volunteers are active in hosting grassroots campaigns throughout the year to spread awareness in their communities and raise funds to support AFTD’s work. Education Education is a vital part of AFTDs work to provide help to people navigating a diagnosis and to inform healthcare providers about FTDs onset and how to care for those who are living with the disease. Through multiple initiatives, we are reaching a growing network of persons impacted, clinicians, care professionals, and key community stakeholders to improve care management, bring forward accessible support options, and drive research engagement. To increase the number of physicians who can recognize and distinguish FTD from related dementias or psychiatric disorders, we collaborate with leading experts in diagnosing FTD and care management strategies to build a robust library of educational tools and resources to inform healthcare professionals. In 2023, AFTD welcomed nearly 950 people from 24 countries, 291 of whom were in-person, for our annual Education Conference held in St. Louis, MO and broadcast online.","Advocacy, Health",1-866-507-7222,info@theaftd.org,http://www.theaftd.org/,"2700 Horizon Drive suite 120, King of Prussia, PA, United States",King of Prussia,PA,Closed; Mon - Fri11:00 AM -  7:00 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

It is a leap of faith in the basic goodness of humankind and is proving to be very successful. We are committed to good stewardship and work hard to keep our administrative costs low and to select our recipient families wisely.

Lutheran Social Ministries of New Jersey,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/945,"Mission: Through the power of the Holy Spirit and in response to God’s love as revealed in the Gospel, the mission of Lutheran Social Ministries of New Jersey is to serve those who hurt, who are in need, or who have limited choices. Vision: There are thousands of organizations in our country dedicated to helping people in various ways. Some, like Lutheran Social Ministries of New Jersey (LSMNJ), include the word “ministry” or reference to a religious denomination in their name. The two words “Lutheran” and “Ministry” are significant in our name, because they describe why we serve rather than what we are or who we serve. Many organizations respond to needs. However, LSMNJ does so because we have been loved by God. Our mission is to focus on clearly responding to that love, which is reflected in many different ways. Whether we are providing housing for those with limited resources, offering long-term support for residents impacted by natural disasters, providing one-to-one transitional support for those in need, or providing legal assistance to low-income immigrants through our immigration program—all efforts throughout LSMNJ stem from our mission as set forth in our Mission Statement. We act “in response to God’s love.” That focus translates into how we can best “help those who hurt, who are in need, or who have limited choices.” Although helpful in identifying what we do as an organization, we have also learned that our name can sometimes cause confusion or misunderstanding. Some people think that LSMNJ is a church. Others ask if we only work with church members or serve only Lutherans. So, let me be clear: LSMNJ is here to serve all New Jersey residents regardless of religious affiliation or background. This understanding of who we are and why we serve is part of the reason that we have wide support from a diversity of people, businesses, foundations, and agencies. Our work each day is a response to the love that God has already shown, and that response is what continues to direct LSMNJ into the future. Services: COMMUNITY SERVICES Community Outreach: Community Engagement (Statewide) works in partnership with individual congregations to provide community outreach services.

Lovefraud Education and Recovery,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/905,"Mission: The mission of Lovefraud Education and Recovery, a New Jersey Nonprofit Corporation, is to educate the world about people with exploitative personality disorders. We do this by offering educational programs and conducting original research. You can help. Education programs have been developed, or are planned, for: - Survivors of relational abuse and interpersonal violence - Therapists and other professionals - High school and college students - High school guidance counselors - Parents of at-risk children Vision: Lovefraud webinars on relationship abuse are presented from the perspective of experience. Almost every instructor learned about the behavior of sociopaths in relationships the hard way — by having them break our hearts, mess with our minds and attempt to destroy us. When it happened to us, we found little effective support. Even the licensed professionals among us realized that our mental health training did not help us. We all had to find our own paths to recovery. We don’t want that to happen to you. So we want to teach you the truth about sociopaths — meaning people who have antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, histrionic or psychopathic personality disorders — and the harm they cause. They abuse almost everyone in their lives — partners, family members, work colleagues and acquaintances. The level of abuse may vary, but sociopaths exploit everyone who has something that they want. If you’re a survivor, from these webinars on relationship abuse you’ll learn how sociopaths manipulate you and everyone else, why you were targeted and how you can recover. If you’re a mental health professional, you’ll learn how to better serve clients who are, or were, in relationships with sociopaths, and are suffering from profound betrayal and trauma. Services: - Webinars on escaping sociopaths, narcissists and relationship abuse - Programs for high school and college students: Young people who encounter sociopaths suffer far more harm than older targets. Teach them about disordered individuals to prevent a lifetime of abuse. - Research on how sociopaths affect their targets: Few researchers study what happens to the targets of sociopaths. Lovefraud fills the knowledge gap by asking survivors about their experiences.","Education, Emergency & Safety",609-945-1384,donna@lovefraud.com,https://education.lovefraud.com/,"3121 Fire Road, Egg Harbor Township, NJ 08234, USA",Egg Harbor Township,NJ,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success

Magnolias Cancer Care,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/1160,"Mission: Here at Magnolias Cancer Care, we’re committed to investing our expertise and resources in order to further achieve our cause. We’ve been supporting our community members in a variety of ways and measuring our success not by monetary size, but by more qualitative measurements such as the scale and effectiveness of our efforts. Just imagine what we can achieve together! Vision: This foundation was the inspiration of Karen Adams Foley, to honor her mother Diana Adams. We lost Diana in 2015 after a fierce battle with lung cancer. Magnolias represent joy, purity, endurance, health and beauty. Diana certainly embodied all these characteristics, and our hope is to carry on her legacy by giving other cancer warriors and their families some assistance by providing access to wigs, hair and makeup for special family photos, as well as helping families as they attempt to raise funds to offset the cost of their medical bills, Not so coincidentally, Sweet Magnolias is a current Netflix program about 3 lifelong friend who support each other through life's ups and downs in a small town which focuses on supporting the people in their community with love, grace, and dignity. This is the passion of our foundation. Services: Magnolias Cancer Care provides comfort kits to our cancer warriors going thru chemotherapy and radiation. These kits includes a soft blanket, comforting products such as chapstick, lotion, anti-nausea lozengers, Norwex cleaning cloths, phone charger, journal, worry stones and busy books. Our hope is to make our warriors a little more comfortable during their treatment. For mastectomy patients, we provide handmade heart shaped pillows. The heart shaped pillows are used to soothe both physical and emotional pain immediately after surgery, radiation or other treatment. Most mastectomy patients are released after surgery with drains that will stay in place for up to 2 weeks. Managing those drains can be challenging and hand sewn drain aprons provide hands free way to hold the drains and move about more freely. They can be worn under clothes to give the patient more flexibility with their garments. The Ryan Project was created from a simple act of paying it forward. After losing his mom to cancer, Ryan listed her medical equipment such as her walker, commode, shower chair on Facebook Marketplace for free. A family who couldn't afford the equipment soon responded. They were so grateful and Ryan was elated to be able to help them out and it then became a passion of his to be able to give back in this way. Ryan said ""This project is to show people that you are not handcuffed to insurances, and we will make your life easier in any way we can."" Magnolias Cancer Care has partnered with a local photographer to offer family photos to our cancer warriors and their families. We also offer to the warriors and families free hair and makeup for their special memories. Ashley's Chic Boutique has partnered with Magnolias Cancer Care to offer help to women who may experience hair loss from cancer treatment. If you or someone you know needs help with medical bills from cancer treatment, Magnolias Cancer Care can help plan a fundraiser.

Vision: To unify neighborhood stakeholders. To create beautiful, functional spaces. To build a better Green Hills for all. Services: Transportation Fund Improving transportation is the number one issue facing the Green Hills neighborhood. The Transportation Summit was our focus on transportation for early 2017. It was a presentation to the community which combined studies and simulations to show traffic improvements to Green Hills. The business district of Green Hills has become a bottleneck for traffic for the region; it creates traffic problems for commuters and residents, alike. Many of the solutions are costly, such as the realignment of key intersections, and it is difficult for the community to support one solution or another without first understanding the data. The proposed Transportation Summit collected, analyzed and presented data on key traffic improvements. The transportation fund would be used to follow-up on continued community education and transportation-related programs, such as the Jolly Trolley route - a compact trolley route in Green Hills over the holidays. We also hosted a transit debate which compiled community answers to our survey on transit, and we received over 400 responses to help shape the debate. The transportation fund might also be used to apply for grants to implement improvements in the Area Transportation Plan (adopted into NashvilleNext, the community plan for the next 25 years). Streetscape Improvements The Streetscape Improvements project encompasses the efforts to make pedestrian connectivity a more realistic option in the business district. If the pedestrian walkways are not pleasant, accessible and easy-to-find, people will simply take their car instead of walking. The first level of Streetscape Improvements include: wayfinding signs, trees, landscaping, benches, lighting and access to green space. The first phase of the wayfinding program would provide pedestrian-level maps on attractive, identity-creating kiosks; the budget for this first phase is $15,000 (the design fee is $5.6K of this amount). Educational Programming The Educational Programming is focused on community planning in Green Hills and Nashville. By keeping the community informed with quarterly meetings (formerly monthly) and newsletters, the stakeholders come to the table with a common understanding of how we might implement key projects within our current community plans. For 2019-2020, we have moved into an e-meeting format for a mayoral candidate questionnaire, which gathers questions from the community and solicits responses from the candidates, in order to inform the community on the candidates' views. Another goal for 2019 is a charrette to explore the vision for Green Hills.",Community & Economic Development,,allianceforgreenhills@gmail.com,http://www.all4greenhills.com,"Nashville, TN, USA",Nashville,TN,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success

Wolf Trap residencies and workshops also provide training for teachers in arts-based instruction techniques they can employ in their classrooms. In 2018-19, TPAC’s Wolf Trap program provided 95 seven-week residencies in 16 Davidson County Head Start Centers and other early childhood centers in Nashville serving 1,587 preschool children. In residency evaluations, 94% of participating teachers noted positive student growth in four main categories of early learning: Emerging literacy, Individual development, Academic goals, and Social behavior. Disney in Schools In 2011, Disney Theatrical Group selected TPAC and Metro Nashville Public Schools for the first pilot of Disney Musicals in Schools (DMIS) outside of New York City.

Music Neighbors,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/131,"Mission: We’re a nonprofit media & production resource for Nashville’s music communities. Through our programs, we provide a platform for artists to record new music, connect their songs to a larger audience, bring even more value to their artistry, and amplify their voices for building a better community. Our ambition is to connect people to more Nashville music artists of all genres. We believe diversity in music is important, and work hard to create a safe and positive space for the community to discover new music. The platform we’ve created allows artists of any size or notoriety to fully express themselves in the way they envision. Vision: We envision an even more sustainable, inclusive, and accessible music scene for all of Nashville’s communities to engage with and participate in. Exploration & Enrichment - We encourage people to discover new music, especially from genres they don’t typically listen to, and to be open to expanding their musical pallet. Equity & Inclusion - We believe every musician and music lover should feel welcome in the music community and be provided the same opportunities and accessibility regardless of their demographic makeup or genre of choice. We aim to make people feel positive, safe, and comfortable to explore and participate in Nashville’s music scene. Service & Support - We administer opportunities to all artists in our community to have access to professional content creation, to connect their music to a larger audience, and to aid in furthering their music careers. Empower & Amplify - We provide a platform for artists to have their voices and stories heard and seek to amplify them to as large of an audience as possible. Community Building - We strive to connect different communities through the power of music as it is not restricted by societal boundaries and has the capability of building bridges between different cultures and demographics of people. This art form provides a communal space for people to interact in both the digital and physical worlds that we live in today. Services: Subsidized Media Production Services: Our organization cares a lot about connecting people to more Nashville music artists of all genres. We believe diversity in music is important and we work hard to create a safe and positive platform for the community to discover new music. The platform we’ve created allows artists to fully express themselves in the way they see fit. We work with artists of any size and we have no notoriety requirements. We provide professional content creation services below fair market value. We simply ask artists to pay the amount they are able to on a sliding scale for our work. Every dollar we receive is put right back into the nonprofit to fund our initiatives. The services we provide are as follows: • Fully produced and professional Live Music Videos • Single Reviews and Artist Interviews • Concert Photography at local shows Additionally, members have access to the following for free through our website: • Artist Spotlights • The Artist Discovery section on our website • Our Concert Calendar Play It Forward: Our organization is helping to combat the rising costs of living in Nashville along with the increasing costs of recording new music by providing free studio time for music artists that are nominated by our talent selection committee. We provide live EPs and video promo packages to help these artists record new music and acquire content to connect their music to their fans and new people. There is no cost to the artists participating in this program. We cover the costs of the studio time, engineer, video crew, and production of the video and audio which is then used for the live music videos that we capture and create. Mix It Up Showcases: Music City is the nickname given to Nashville because of the incredible music community and scene we have. However, most live music events occurring in Nashville don’t fully reflect all of the different genres and musical styles that Nashville has to offer. Most music appreciators listen to a wide variety of music and want more accessibility to a wide range of music genres and styles. However, many live music events in Nashville favor popular genres such as Americana, country, and rock. Certain music artists, such as hip-hop and LatinX, have a much harder time booking shows than country or rock musicians. We believe there is a void within the music community and wanted to provide the opportunity to explore several different genres of music within one artist showcase. Song Craft Sessions: Creating music is an interesting art form that differs from artist to artist. This video series intertwines live music performances with artist discussions about their songwriting process. We wanted to give our viewers an insider's perspective on what influences musicians to create the music they do, how they go about writing new music, and why music is important to them. Good Neighbors Listen: Music has the power to heal and bring to light issues we face as individuals and communities. We provide music artists and bands with a platform to amplify their voices to share their stories of dealing with trauma, overcoming life’s challenges, facing discrimination and/or adversity, and so forth. Many artists use music as a form of therapy and write songs to help them manage trauma, discuss societal issues that negatively impact Nashville such as racism and sexism, and bring people together to establish stronger communities that encourage equity and diversity. We believe that giving these artists the space to address these issues is vital to continually improve our community.","Arts & Culture, Media & Broadcasting",615-925-9390,hello@musicneighbors.org,https://www.musicneighbors.org/,"433 W Bend Dr, Nashville, TN 37209, USA",Nashville,TN,No Set Business Hours - Call to Inquire,,success

Private School Village,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/1430,"Mission: Private School Village (PSV) cultivates and harnesses the power of community to positively transform the private school experience for Black and Brown families so that students fully thrive. Services: LA Wildfires: giftcards apply at: https://www.privateschoolvillage.org/emergencysupportresources list of resources: https://www.privateschoolvillage.org/emergencysupportresources Program Pillar: Racial Socialization Rooted in research conducted by Dr. Howard Stevenson in the 90s, PSV is centered around increasing racial socialization. This is especially important during the most important developmental stages of adolescents as it prepares children for anticipatory experiences, builds cultural pride, provides an opportunity for (re)affirmation, and educates about racial inequalities. Some schools offer informal or formal affinity spaces, which are vital. Yet, there is an inconsistent experience for most Black and Brown students for myriad reasons (e.g., groups led by untrained facilitators, not fully understanding the needs of the affinity group, leaning too heavily on matriculating parents to manage initiatives, not resourcing groups in a meaningful way, low representation, etc). Programs include: Grade-Level Social Pods, High School Advisory & Teen Committee, and Parent Ambassador Program. Additionally, many all-community gatherings provide opportunities for affirmation & cultural celebration. Program Pillar: Racial Literacy Racial literacy is a form of racial socialization and antiracist training used by parents to prepare and protect their children against racism. Its a concept that focuses on teaching how to identify, counter, and cope with racism. It is a practical, intentional effort designed to prepare and empower and involves understanding the intersections of power and race, recognizing racial systems, and adequately articulating racial terms. Through existing PSV programs, PSV works to help families and students build racial literacy skills in formal and informal ways. Many under-represented families navigate two worldsone outside of school and another inside the school community. PSV helps bridge the gap from the earliest moments of joining the private school community, so that they are protected and prepared to thrive despite racial situations that often arise. Program Pillar: Representation Low racial representation breeds a limited, distorted view of anyone not white in private schools and sends a strong message to all students about value, future possibilities, and more. PSV purposefully works to increase representation in several ways including focusing on the growth and retention of current Black and Brown students and families and the ongoing opportunity to recruit new families. Additionally, PSV works to support and build a pipeline of racially diverse parent volunteers primed for Board service in our schools. Through events and programs, PSV fosters community and addresses feelings of isolation, strengthens a sense of belonging, and educates and empowers PSV parents to be more engaged and in partnership with their school communities. Programs Include: Parent Ambassador Program, Somos PSV, Trustee Leadership Program. Program Pillar: Research PSV is committed to increasing opportunities to better capture and share data focused on the Black and Brown experience in private schools. For example, there is currently no comprehensive national, aggregated data that includes tracking of Black senior administrators, Black teachers, and Black faculty and Black staff in private schools. Or rather, this data is not readily available and shared so that interested stakeholders can collectively work towards improvement. The National Center for Education Statistics bi-annual Private School Universe Survey currently tracks a lot of information.

Once admitted to the program, students must pay $25 per semester, maintain at least a 3.0 GPA and keep a clean disciplinary record. The use of technology to support teaching and learning is emphasized. Students are assigned desk-top computers in a large computer lab and starting summer 2016 with Biology I, THEI began offering the first internet courses behind bars in TN. Since then we have offered 2 every semester including Biology I/II, Accounting I/II, Macroeconomics and Computer Applications, so that students are gaining much needed computer skills that will help them be successful in a 21st century economy. THEI College Program at Northwest Industrial Complex: In November 2016 THEI expanded our reach to West Tennessee when we started a new college program at Northwest Correctional Complex(NWCX), a medium security prison for men in Tiptonville, Tennessee. Our servicing partner at Northwest, Dyersburg State Community College (DSCC), began offering classes to a cohort of 25 students on January 2017. The NWCX program follows the THEI model that was successfully established at 2 prisons in Middle Tennessee - Charles Bass and the Turney Center. The men are organized into a cohort, or learning community, work full-time during the day and take 2-3 courses per semester working towards an A.S. Degree in Business Administration from DSCC. Should a student be released prior to earning his degree, credits earned from these courses are recognized and transferable to any public college or university in TN, as well as many private ones in the Southeastern region. In order to be admitted to the program, each applicant must take the standard TN college placement exam and place at college level in reading and writing; complete the application and write an essay. Once admitted to the program, students must pay $25 fee each semester, maintain at least a 3.0 GPA and keep a clean disciplinary record. Technology is an important piece of the program as it was desired that incarcerated students experience technological equity, to the extent possible, with DSCC campus students. Students are assigned desk-top computers with Microsoft office and other non-internet based software. The prisoners are gaining much needed computer skills (i.e. excel, powerpoint, Microsoft office…), which will help them be successful in a 21st century digital world. Our Immediate Reentry Track (IRT) is for students who are eligible for release within 2 years. At present, roughly 30% of THEI college students at Turney Center are eligible for release within two years, the majority of whom will be released to communities in Middle Tennessee. Research shows that incarcerated individuals who come in contact with a resource practitioner multiple times before release are far more likely to seek support from that person after release. In order to increase the likelihood of degree completion post-release, our Support Services Coordinator develops release plans with students through weekly one-on-one meetings at the prison, up to a year prior to each person's anticipated release date. These meetings establish a relationship of trust and support, and typically include career planning, help securing financial aid, selecting and applying to colleges, and help transferring credits to a new institution. All credits and degrees earned from courses taken through THEI are transferable to all public colleges and universities in the state as well as many private schools in the region. Alumni Support Services: THEI helps students develop their release plans prior to returning home, and then execute and adapt the plans in the weeks and months following release.","Education, Inmate & Formerly Incarcerated",615-879-8857,info@thei.org,http://www.thei.org,"1006 Shelby Avenue, Nashville, TN 37206, USA",Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon - Fri11:00 AM -  7:00 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

Urban Housing Solutions (UHS) began in 1991when our founder, Rusty Lawrence, organized a group of funders and social service experts to acquire a motel property and convert it to housing for chronically homeless individuals. Over the next 20 years, UHS focused on renovating old properties into housing for other populations with special housing needs - including those living with HIV/AIDS, individuals needing mental health support, those struggling with addiction, deaf and hard of hearing adults, and other vulnerable individuals and families. In these partnerships, UHS has provided the “hardware” of housing through its development/property management activities and our team of service coordinators connect residents to the “software” of supportive services provided by other nonprofits and social service agencies. Working with our public and private partners, UHS provides affordable homes in supportive communities across greater Nashville. As Nashville’s growth over the last decade has enacted more pressure on the affordability of housing, UHS has increased the scale of its development efforts to meet these needs - focusing on new construction and the preservation of larger apartment communities.

"Make a Wish of Middle Tennessee, Inc.",https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/140,"Mission: Together, we create life-changing wishes for children with critical illnesses. Vision: We believe that these children and their families deserve the chance to enjoy once-in-a-lifetime experiences that relieve them of the immense stress accompanying the treatment of a life-threatening medical condition, and produce positive, hopeful mindsets that outlast the illness. The organization's wish-granting activities accomplish this by augmenting traditional medicine, impacting each child's emotional state and the family unit - the child's primary support structure. By granting the child's one heartfelt wish, and involving the entire immediate family in the process, we re-empower the child to fight his/her illness and energize the family - and the community - to support the child. Our long-term goal, or vision, is to be able to make every eligible child's wish come true. By granting increasingly more wishes each year to qualifying children, we anticipate that, one day, we will be able to fulfill every eligible child's wish and propagate the joyful outcomes to an ever-wider community of participants and witnesses. Services: Make-A-Wish America has completed a new strategic plan for the organization's next three fiscal years. In this plan, we are focusing on four pillars: 1) brand management, 2) fundraising effectiveness, 3) talent development and 4) operational effectiveness. We have outlined a series of initiatives for each of these efforts and a specific individual has been identified to oversee each activity. Importantly, we will be reporting our progress on each initiative on a quarterly basis to the organization's National Board of Directors. We believe that executing on these initiatives will lead us on a path to achieving our vision of making every eligible child's wish come true. Brand management entails spreading awareness of the need for wishes. To do this, we will concentrate on defining and articulating the ""power of a wish"" and the impact of that wish on our communities. We will upgrade our online presence and further develop our methods of communicating our mission into 21st Century models of interactive multimedia and storytelling. Additionally, we will continue to leverage our strong relationships with the entertainment and sports industries to assist us in granting wishes and telling our story. To fund more wishes, Make-A-Wish America will continue its focus on developing fundraising programs that honor the philanthropic desires of our individual and corporate donors. We will take a donor-centric approach and implement new technologies and infrastructure to enhance the giving experience through a Board-driven culture of philanthropy. In the area of talent development, we will continue our efforts to enhance the capabilities and skills of our leaders through specific leadership development programs. We will enhance Make-A-Wish University, our online curriculum that provides training for our staff and volunteers in wish granting, fundraising, communications, finance, human resources, governance and leadership. We are also instituting a series of orientations and conferences for each of these disciplines to align the organization's skill sets with the outcomes articulated in the Strategic Plan. We will also improve our operational activities by finding and developing efficiencies through best practices and new technologies, ultimately redirecting these cost savings toward wish granting. For example, we will complete the implementation of the Make-A-Wish Suite, a common information technology platform, at the national office and at each of our chapters. We will also continue to upgrade and reconfigure systems that support our fundraising and communications initiatives. Additionally, we are in the middle of an ongoing study that is providing quantitative measures of the outcomes and overall impact of wishes. This information is providing us with findings to share with our constituents, and serving as a baseline measure to inform us of our progress toward the realization of our organizational vision and strategic goals.","Advocacy, Children & Family Services, Disability Services, Youth Development",615-221-2200,,https://wish.org/midtn,"600 Hill Avenue suite 201, Nashville, TN 37210, USA",Nashville,TN,Closed; Mon - Fri11:00 AM -  7:00 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

Building Lives Foundation,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/303,"Mission: Our mission is to eliminate homelessness among our country's veterans. We do this by providing assistance to veterans who are on the verge of going homeless through our Homeless Prevention Program. Through Project Advance, our program to transition homeless veterans to sustained independent living, we also seek to reduce the population of veterans who are homeless or incarcerated, by providing the opportunities necessary for a successful re-entry into society to those veterans who have made a decision to change their lives. We do this in gratitude to those who have given so much of themselves to preserve the freedoms we so greatly enjoy. Our mission is to support and service your housing needs by providing first-time homebuyer education, foreclosure counseling and debt management services. Our goal is to preserve homeownership for all individuals and families, regardless of their income. Services: Housing Building Lives provide housing for homeless veterans who have successfully completed transitional living programs (i.e. Operation Stand Down). An individual's income is considered in determining placement thus assuring affordability. We have a partnership with Urban Housing Solutions, First Nashville Realty Management, and one of our board members to provide housing for our participants. We also have a transitional home for men in the Nashville area. Job Placement Building Lives has a partnership with StaffMark and Prologistix to assist in placing our clients in jobs. We also utilize the state employment centers and contact many other corporations seeking employment opportunities. Employment is the key component to the successful transition for individuals from the ranks of the homeless or the recently incarcerated. Over the years, we have established a comprehensive group of partners who will hire our clients. These partners include: Home Depot, Midas, Mrs. Grissom's Salads, Dollar General, Demo's, Waffle House, and approximately 50 other corporations. Car Ownership and Asset Development Each participant must have reliable transportation in order to increase the probability for job retention. A creative program has been developed that allows each participant to purchase a car in an affordable way. Car Plus/Midas shops repair any found problems. Repayment is made with no interest charged. Payments are no more than $200/month for 12 to 18 months. Personal Assistance Building Lives provides up to $1,500 per participant for personal needs in the first 8 weeks of assistance. This includes meeting needs such as: furniture, home furnishings, rent, utilities, and food. While Building Lives addresses a number of basic needs, one primary emphasis is building the individual's ""community"". Re-connecting with family, becoming active in a church of their choice, and joining organizations with similar interests are all important in the individual's journey. Clothing Building Lives helps participants get appropriate clothing through partnerships with Churches or by purchases for the client at Thrift Smart, Goodwill, or Salvation Army. Transitional Housing Program Building Lives operates a transitional housing program named The Academy. The property, located 3541 Wood Bridge is leased by The Academy. Maximum capacity is 11 beds, and there is a full-service kitchen that provides three meals per day for the residents and staff. The residents are referred to us by VA, Street Works, TBOP, and other organizations who interact with the homeless in the Nashville and surrounding area. Upon successful completion of a 30-day probationary period, residents are provided a small stipend, and if able, are assigned to one of several work crews. The Academy is a ""work therapy"" program designed to get the men back into a responsible work routine while re-acquiring employable skills. Typical time spent in this program is from 8 to 12 months with some staying as long as 2 years. When appropriate, individuals are placed in outside jobs and with help and assistance, begin to prepare for the transition to independent living. This includes support in preparing resumes, setting up interviews with potential employers, helping them acquire an automobile, and helping them get established in a furnished apartment. They will remain in contact with Building Lives staff and volunteers as they begin to assume more and more responsibility for their future success. Homeless Prevention The Homeless Prevention program identifies veterans who are on the verge of losing their permanent residence. Once the situation is verified through an eviction notice, foreclosure notice, or notice from utility company of cut off, then financial assistance is provided to prevent the imminent loss of home. A case worker/resource coordinator is assigned to work with the client for up to a year to address issues, provide financial training, and provide opportunities/options that will stabilize their situation.","Employment, Housing & Homelessness, Veteran & Military",(615) 678-4967,jeff@wearebuildinglives.org,https://www.wearebuildinglives.org/,"2000 Mallory Ln suite 130 166, Franklin, TN 37067, USA",Franklin,TN,Closed; Mon - Fri10:00 AM -  6:00 PM (EDT); SatClosed; SunClosed,,success

Tennessee World Affairs Council,https://www.givingconnection.org/locations/488,"Mission: The mission of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Tennessee World Affairs Council is to promote international awareness, understanding and connections to enhance the region’s global stature and to prepare Tennesseans to thrive in our increasingly complex and connected world. Services: Distinguished Visiting Speaker Program The presentation of knowledgeable, experienced speakers to communities that would not otherwise have the opportunity to listen to and question these speakers is a flagship program of TNWAC. The Council, delivers thoughtful, provocative, experienced speakers from various fields, such as the American and foreign diplomatic communities, academia, the military, the business world, and elsewhere. Recent examples are Senator Bob Corker, Chairman Senate Foreign Relations Committee; Ambassadors from Russia, Ireland, Czechia, Kazakhstan and the President of the US Institute of Peace. In addition to its signature “Global Town Halls” at Belmont University the Council works with partnering organizations -- civic groups, universities, schools, corporate partners, and others -- to host the distinguished visiting speakers around the community. Global Dialogue Discussion Groups Local discussion groups – like a ‘salon’ – bring people together for casual conversations about international issues in the news. The Council has a monthly program to facilitate social meetings for that purpose. The Council prepares background materials to prepare the participants – several articles as well as online videos, maps, reference material and a longer list of readings to expand the participants’ knowledge if they want to dig deeper. The roughly one-hour conversations are facilitated by a Council member and sometimes a subject specialist but the focus is on everyone contributing their views. The discussion is guided by a set of key points and may conclude with a poll of members concerning their conclusions – the poll results to be provided to government officials. More venues will be added as demand increases and the program is available ‘off the shelf’ for groups to use as global affairs fellowship sessions. Global Focus Web Casts/Webinars To reach classrooms and communities around Tennessee the Council is developing a Web cast capability to connect international decision and policy-makers, authors, scholars and more to students, community groups and individuals. The concept was proven through an interactive Webinar featuring distinguished Beirut-based journalist Rami Khouri who talked with Tennessee students, Council members and even audiences from around the network of World Affairs Councils about Middle East developments (video archived on TNWAC.org). The Web cast concept is one example of how the Council will use technology as a multiplier to reach the widest audience in its mission to share an understanding of the world. The Council is building a project to deliver regular Web casts that will be available to Tennessee classrooms and beyond connecting them to young professionals working around the world – in particular junior Foreign Service Officers in American embassies. The object of the interactive link will be to inform students first hand about the countries in which the young diplomats serve, their living and working situations, and how they came to be in those positions. Academic WorldQuest Academic WorldQuest is a Flagship Program of the world affairs council system. The game was invented by the Charlotte Council and is now widely played at the adult and high school levels around the country. It is a team game testing competitors' knowledge of international affairs, geography, history, and culture. The World Affairs Councils of America started the national competition in Washington, DC in March 2003. Participants come from high schools that work with the World Affairs Council network. It is unique to the world affairs council system and has no direct competitor among K-12 knowledge-based competitions in the US or abroad. Podcast The Tennessee World Affairs Council (TNWAC) launched the “Global Tennessee” Podcast series in 2018 with interviews of scores of policymakers, thought-leaders and specialists. In 2020 the service pivoted to interactive Webinars, to temporarily replace in-person programs during the pandemic crisis.

Education and Awareness Across the nation, our education programs and services all have a common purpose: To improve the lives of all people affected by lupus. We bring together all stakeholders with interest in lupus to translate research findings into useful programs, information, and tools for people with lupus and health professionals to ensure they know about new means to diagnose and manage lupus. Through our national network of local chapters, regional offices, and community-based support groups, the Foundation provides caring support and referrals to people with lupus, their families, and their caregivers, and help guide them through the complexities of living with lupus. We aggressively conduct outreach efforts to increase public understanding of lupus, and share stories of those who have lupus, through national awareness campaigns, celebrity engagement, and online and social marketing. Advocacy The Lupus Foundation of America advocates on behalf of all people with lupus, their families, and the health professionals who care for them. We rally all lupus stakeholders to educate government officials, policymakers, and industry leaders on the urgent need to expand public and private investment in lupus research, education programs, and support services. Through our advocacy efforts, we have stimulated more than $90 million in federal funding for lupus research and education. The Foundation holds an annual policy summit in Washington, DC. Each year, hundreds of lupus advocates from across the country visit Capitol Hill, and thousands more join virtually, to urge Members of Congress to help advance the development of new lupus treatments, increase funding for lupus research and education and ensure people with lupus have access to affordable, quality health coverage and care. MAPRx Coalition The Foundation is the convener for MAPRx, a coalition of patient, family caregiver and health professional organizations committed to safeguarding the well-being of patients with chronic diseases and disabilities who rely on Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage. MAPRx member organizations advocate on behalf of these beneficiaries and collaborate with national and state policymakers to ensure they have access to the medication therapies they need and deserve. World Lupus Federation The Foundation is the founder of the World Lupus Federation, a coalition of more than 200 lupus groups around the world, united to improve the quality of life for all people affected by lupus. Through coordinated efforts among its global affiliates, the Federation creates greater awareness and understanding of lupus, provides education and services to people living with the disease, and advocates on their behalf.

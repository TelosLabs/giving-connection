  ### Throttle Spammy Clients ###

  # If any single client IP is making tons of requests, then they're
  # probably malicious or a poorly-configured scraper. Either way, they
  # don't deserve to hog all of the app server's CPU. Cut them off!
  #
  # Note: If you're serving assets through rack, those requests may be
  # counted by rack-attack and this throttle may be activated too
  # quickly. If so, enable the condition to exclude them from tracking.

  # Throttle all requests by IP (60rpm)
  throttle("req/ip", limit: 300, period: 5.minutes) do |req|
    req.ip unless req.path.start_with?("/assets")
  end

  ### Prevent Registration Spam ###

  # Stricter throttling for suspicious email domains

        Rails.logger.info "[Rack::Attack] Is suspicious domain? #{!ALLOWED_EMAIL_PROVIDERS.include?(domain)}"

  ### Prevent Brute-Force Login Attacks ###

  # The most common brute-force login attack is a brute-force password
  # attack where an attacker simply tries a large number of emails and
  # passwords to see if any credentials match.
  #
  # Another common method of attack is to use a swarm of computers with
  # different IPs to try brute-forcing a password for a specific account.

  # Throttle POST requests to /login by IP address
  throttle("logins/ip", limit: 5, period: THROTTLE_PERIODS[:login]) do |req|
    if req.path == "/login" && req.post?
      req.ip
    end
  end

  # Throttle POST requests to /login by email param
  throttle("logins/email", limit: 5, period: THROTTLE_PERIODS[:login]) do |req|
    if req.path == "/login" && req.post?
      req.params["email"].to_s.downcase.gsub(/\s+/, "").presence
    end
  end

  ### Custom Throttle Response ###

  # By default, Rack::Attack returns an HTTP 429 for throttled responses,
  # which is just fine.
  #
  # If you want to return 503 so that the attacker might be fooled into
  # believing that they've successfully broken your app (or you just want to
  # customize the response), then uncomment these lines.
  # self.throttled_responder = lambda do |env|
  #  [ 503,  # status
  #    {},   # headers
  #    ['']] # body
  # end

  # Clean up expired keys periodically (runs async in Redis)
  if defined?(Rails.cache) && Rails.cache.respond_to?(:redis)
    Rails.cache.redis.with do |redis|
      redis.expire(CACHE_PREFIX, 24.hours.to_i)
    end
  end
